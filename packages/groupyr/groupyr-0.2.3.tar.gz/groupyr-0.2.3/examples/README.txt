Examples
================

These examples use the sparse group lasso and synthetic data to demonstrate
how groupyr can be used to solve penalized regression problems with grouped
covariates. Because the data is synthetically generated, we know the "ground
truth" and can compare to the estimated important features chosen by the
groupyr models.
