  SentimentBot thinks that this comment is toxic. Perhaps SentimentBot got it
  wrong. But then again, maybe you did.

  Please reread your comment and take advantage of any opportunities to "turn
  down the temperature." We want the groupyr community to be inclusive and
  welcoming. Please be respectful of other users and think about ways to
  communicate the same message in a more delicate manner. cc/ @richford
