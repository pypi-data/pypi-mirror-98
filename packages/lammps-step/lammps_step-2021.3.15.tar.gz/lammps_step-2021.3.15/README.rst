SEAMM LAMMPS Plug-in
====================

A SEAMM plug-in for LAMMPS, a forcefield-based molecular dynamics code.

This plug-in provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting up
complex simulations using LAMMPS. It uses a sub-flowchart that
provides steps such as constant pressure and temperature (NPT)
dynamics which give access to the functionality in LAMMPS in a more
consistent and understandable way than the inscrutable fixes that
LAMMPS uses.

These sub-flowcharts mirror the main flowchart in form and function
and can use the same variables such as temperature and pressure that
are accessible anywhere in the flowcharts. This allows "programming" a
LAMMPS workflow in the same familiar way that SEAMM uses to represent
the overall workflow.

Features
--------

* Use of any forcefield supported by the forcefield plug-in:

  - PCFF
  - OpenKIM: EAM, MEAM, LJ, ReaxFF

* Molecular statics: minimization
* Molecular dynamics: NVE, NVT, and NPT with any of the approaches
  supported in LAMMPS
* Automatic statistical analysis of averages from MD

  - Detection of equilibration
  - Mean and standard error of the mean for the sampling after
    equilibration
  - Autocorrelation function and time
  - Statistical inefficiency
  - Plotting of results in the Dashboard

* Using property values to drive MD. Rather than running MD for a
  length of time, automatically run long enough to determine a set of
  properties within given error bars.
