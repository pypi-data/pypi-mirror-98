This is an initial library of BibTex references for the lammps_step plug-in for SEAMM,
generated automatically by the cookiecutter. You may wish to edit the first entry to correct some
of the information.

Add other references to the end of the file and add code in the plug-in to cite the references as
appropriate. This is done with code like this:

        self.references.cite(
            raw=self._bibliography['doi:10.1002/jcc.21224'],
            alias='packmol',
            module='packmol_step',
            level=1,
            note='The principle PACKMOL citation.'
        )

which is typically in the run() method of the plug-in.

The base node class in SEAMM automatically reads this list of references into a dictionary in
self._bibliography with the key being the key of the BibTex entry -- usually the name on the
first line of the entry after the 'article' or 'misc' (for software) keyword.

See the documentation for the Reference Handler for the other arguments to cite().

    abstract = "Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed."

                  measure-preserving integrators and the symplectic property for
                  Hamiltonian systems are briefly reviewed. In addition, current

                  constant-temperature ensemble are also reviewed. A new
                  geometric integrator for the NPT method is presented, is shown
                  to preserve the correct phase-space volume element and is
                  demonstrated to perform well in realistic examples. Finally, a
                  multiple time-step version of the integrator is presented for
                  treating systems with motion on several time scales.}
