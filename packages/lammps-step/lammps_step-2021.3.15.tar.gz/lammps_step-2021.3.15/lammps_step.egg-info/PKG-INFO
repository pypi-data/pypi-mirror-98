        SEAMM LAMMPS Plug-in
        ====================
        
        A SEAMM plug-in for LAMMPS, a forcefield-based molecular dynamics code.
        
        This plug-in provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting up
        complex simulations using LAMMPS. It uses a sub-flowchart that
        provides steps such as constant pressure and temperature (NPT)
        dynamics which give access to the functionality in LAMMPS in a more
        consistent and understandable way than the inscrutable fixes that
        LAMMPS uses.
        
        These sub-flowcharts mirror the main flowchart in form and function
        and can use the same variables such as temperature and pressure that
        are accessible anywhere in the flowcharts. This allows "programming" a
        LAMMPS workflow in the same familiar way that SEAMM uses to represent
        the overall workflow.

        Features
        --------
        
        * Use of any forcefield supported by the forcefield plug-in:
        
          - PCFF
          - OpenKIM: EAM, MEAM, LJ, ReaxFF
        
        * Molecular statics: minimization
        * Molecular dynamics: NVE, NVT, and NPT with any of the approaches
          supported in LAMMPS
        * Automatic statistical analysis of averages from MD
        
          - Detection of equilibration
          - Mean and standard error of the mean for the sampling after
            equilibration
          - Autocorrelation function and time
          - Statistical inefficiency
          - Plotting of results in the Dashboard
        
        * Using property values to drive MD. Rather than running MD for a
          length of time, automatically run long enough to determine a set of
          properties within given error bars.

        2021.2.4.1 (4 February 2021)
        ----------------------------
        
        * Internal patch to fix CI; no changes for users.
        
        2021.2.4 (4 February 2021)
        --------------------------
        
        * Updated for compatibility with the new system classes in MolSystem
          2021.2.2 release.
        
        2020.12.4 (4 December 2020)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Internal: switching CI from TravisCI to GitHub Actions, and in the
          process moving documentation from ReadTheDocs to GitHub Pages where
          it is consolidated with the main SEAMM documentation.
        
        2020.11.2 (2 November 2020)
        ---------------------------
        
        * Updated to be compatible with the new command-line argument
          handling.
        
        2020.10.13 (13 October 2020)
        ----------------------------
        
        * Added capability to run MD until a set of user-selected properties
          are converged to requested accuracy.
        
        2020.9.25 (25 September 2020)
