   changelog

This is a `cloud.gov <https://cloud.gov/>`_ UAA authentication backend
for Django. Features include:

* A handy :ref:`fake cloud.gov <fakeauth>`
  that makes it easy to log in as any user during development.

* Transparent refreshing of short-lived access tokens, ensuring that
  users are automatically logged out of the system soon after cloud.gov
  says they are unauthorized.

To get started, see the :doc:`quickstart`.
