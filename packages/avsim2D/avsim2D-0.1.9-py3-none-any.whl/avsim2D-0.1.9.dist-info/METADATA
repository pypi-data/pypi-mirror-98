# Autonomous Vehicule Simulator 2D


## Purpose

This package is a 2D simulator for autonomous vehicule. The simulator is based on pygame.  
The main purpose is to train students on CAN-Bus and to introduce them self-driving vehicule problematics. The vehicule is piloted by CAN drive-by-wire.
Important to know : Self-driving features are not developped as they are supposed to be done by students. This package is done for educationnal purposes.

## Drive-by-wire features

### Actuators
- Powertrain
  - Accelerate
  - Brake
  - Turn
- Lightings :
  - Blink left
  - Blink right
  - Low beam
  - High Beam

### Sensors
- Dashboard
  - Speed
  - Motor Speed
  - Gear selection
- SDV sensor
  - Front camera with semantic segmentation with following masks :
    - road
    - stop
    - yield
    - crossing
    - car_park
