It includes the various `problems` to be defined by the user in order to perform certain analyses, such as
- `AeroProblem`
- `StructProblem`
- `AeroStructProblem`

It also contains some class definitions shared by various solvers, such as `AeroSolver`.
Finally, it also contains a class, `BaseRegTest`, which is used as part of the testing toolchain.
