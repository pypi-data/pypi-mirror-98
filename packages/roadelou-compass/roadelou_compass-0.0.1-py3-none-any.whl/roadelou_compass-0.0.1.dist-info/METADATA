# Compass

> Disclaimer: This is a personal side-project

__Compass__ :compass: is a small programming language with strong inpiration from [Esterel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esterel). It is a _synchronous programming language_ meant to build finite state machines easily for your C code.

Unlike Esterel, Compass is very bare bones and uses a rather trivial compilation process, which can lead to very different behaviours for code that looks similar.

The __ABRO__ code example adapted for Compass looks like :arrow_down_small:

```
module abro(input A, input B, input R, output O) {
    each R {
        seq {
            par {
                await A;
                await B;
            };
            emit O;
        }
    }
}
```

# Installation

The Compass compiler is distributed as a Python source package. To install it, one can run :arrow_down_small:

```bash
# Fetch the source code
git clone https://github.com/roadelou/compass.git
# Go into the repository
cd compass
# Install the python package
pip3 install .
``` 

# Usage

Once the compiler is installed, it can be used from the terminal through the `compass` command. Basic usage is :arrow_down_small:

```bash
# This will output a C file called abro_compass.cmps
compass abro.cmps
# To compile the header file to use the C code.
compass --lang header abro.cmps
# To compile a CLI interface to test the module.
compass --lang debug abro.cmps
```

# Examples

Some examples of the language can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/roadelou/compass/examples) folder.
