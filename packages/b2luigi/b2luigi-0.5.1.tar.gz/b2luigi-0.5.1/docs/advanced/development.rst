Development and TODOs
=====================

You want to help developing ``b2luigi``? Great! Have your github account ready and let's go!


Local Development
-----------------

You want to help developing ``b2luigi``? Great! Here are some first steps to help you dive in:

1.  Make sure you uninstall ``b2luigi`` if you have installed if from pypi

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip3 uninstall b2luigi

2.  Clone the repository from github

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/nils-braun/b2luigi

3.  ``b2luigi`` is not using ``setuptools`` but the newer (and better) flit_ as a a builder.
    Install it via

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip3 [ --user ] install flit

    You can now install ``b2luigi`` from the cloned git repository in development mode:

    .. code-block:: bash

        flit install -s

4.  The documentation is hosted on read the docs and build automatically on every commit to main.
    You can (and should) also build the documentation locally by installing ``sphinx``

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip3 [ --user ] install sphinx sphinx-autobuild

    And starting the automatic build process in the projects root folder

    .. code-block:: bash

        sphinx-autobuild docs build

    The autobuild will rebuild the project whenever you change something. It displays a URL where to find
    the created docs now (most likely http://127.0.0.1:8000).
    Please make sure the documentation looks fine before creating a pull request.

5.  If you are a core developer and want to release a new version:

    a.  Make sure all changes are committed and merged on main
    b.  Use the ``bumpversion`` package to update the version in the python file ``b2luigi/__init__.py`` as well
        as the git tag. ``flit`` will automatically use this.

        .. code-block:: bash

            bumpversion patch/minor/major

    c.  Push the new commit and the tags

        .. code-block:: bash

            git push 
            git push --tags

    d.  Publish to pipy

        .. code-block:: bash

            flit publish

    At a later stage, I will try to automate this.


Open TODOs
----------

* Add support for different batch systems, e.g. htcondor and a batch system discovery
* Integrate dirac or other grid systems as another batch system
* Add helper messages on events (e.g. failed)
