        JupyterLab extension to show a flash effect when a cell is executed.
        
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * JupyterLab >= 2.0
        
        ## Install
        
        For JupyterLab 3.x, the extension can be installed with `pip`:
        
        ```bash
        pip install jupyterlab-cell-flash
        ```
        
        For JupyterLab 1.x and 2.x:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-cell-flash
        ```
        
        
        ## Settings
        
        Use the following settings to tweak the color and the duration of the animation (in `Settings > Advanced Settings Editor`):
        
        ```json5
        {
          // The base color for the flash effect
          "color": "rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5)",
        
          // The duration of the flash effect animation (in seconds)
          "duration": 0.5
        }
        ```

        ### Development install
        
        Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.
        
        The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
        [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
        `yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.
        
        ```bash
        # Clone the repo to your local environment
        # Change directory to the jupyterlab-cell-flash directory
        # Install package in development mode
        pip install -e .
        # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
        jlpm run install:extension
        # Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
        jlpm run build
        ```
        
        You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.
        
        ```bash
        # Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
        jlpm run watch
        # Run JupyterLab in another terminal
        jupyter lab
        ```
        
        With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).
        
        ### Uninstall
        
        ```bash
        pip uninstall jupyterlab-cell-flash
        jupyter labextension uninstall jupyterlab-cell-flash
        ```
