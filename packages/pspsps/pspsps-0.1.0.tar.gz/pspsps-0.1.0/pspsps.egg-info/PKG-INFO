        ![A screenshot of pspsps(1) invoking catgirls nya.](screenshot1.png)
        
        pspsps(1) is nice and tries to guess the best options for you~ ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ    
        for most ppl u can just call `pspsps` n it will work! probably (｡•̀ᴗ~)-✧
        
        u can control colours, backnyends n stuff.    
        call it with -h, the options should be self-explanyative.
        
        if it looks wrong try with less colours!    
        the more columns and lines in your terminyal, the better the drawings
        will look.
        
        catgirls are kindly provided by Safebooru.    
        u can call other peoples too with `--tags`. like

        there are optinyons to make them smaller or bigger or save the images
        or load from an image and meowre!    
        
        ![pspsps(1) is saving a drawing of catgirls in love](screenshot3.png)
        
        u can also make drawings with nyascii characters nyanstead of colourful nyansi
        art.  tho the mangas in nyascii dont look so good in most terminyal sizes, mew.
