Bigger tasks
============

- (API-) Documentation (work in progress)

- A pluggable settings screen for content items for things like 'allow
  discussion', 'default page'.

- Allow in-page macros for things like 'table of contents' (for
  listing all contained pages in a TOC style).  See
  https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kotti/Kck0kYK3EkQ/YCu45JsJbI8J

- Add an item to the control panel that lists a list of logged
  application exceptions.  Possibly other introspectable features,
  like version numbers etc.

Have an idea for this list?  Discuss at
http://groups.google.com/group/kotti or #kotti on IRC.
