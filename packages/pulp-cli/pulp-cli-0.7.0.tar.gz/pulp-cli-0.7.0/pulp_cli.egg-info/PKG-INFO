Description: # Pulp command line interface
        
        This is a command line interface for Pulp 3.
        
        This software is in beta and future releases may include backwards incompatible changes.
        
        ## General command syntax
        
        `pulp [<global_options>] <plugin> <resource_class> [--type <resource_type>] <action> [<action_options>]`
        
        Global options include:
        
          * `--base-url`
          * `--user`
          * `--password`
          * `--config`
          * `--format`
          * `-v`/`-vv`/`-vvv`
        
        ## Quick start
        
        To install and use the CLI, run these commands:
        
        ```
        pip install pulp-cli[pygments]
        pulp config create -e
        ```
        
        Read [the installation and configuration doc](docs/install.md) for more information.
        
        ## Known issues
        
          * Redirecting from `http` to `https`, as done by a typical Pulp installation,
            does not work properly with `POST` and `PUT` requests.
            Please use `https://` in the base url.
            Note that the attempt to use `http` leaks sensitive data over an unencrypted connection.
        
        ## Example commands
        
        `pulp status`
        
        `pulp file repository list`
        
        `pulp file repository create --name file_repo1`
        
        `pulp file repository update --name file_repo1 --description "Contains plain files"`
        
        `pulp file repository destroy --name file_repo1`
        
        To learn about the structure of a command, you can use the `--help` option with any (in-)complete command.
        
        ## Shell Completion
        
        The CLI uses the click package which supports shell completion.
        To configure this, check out [click's
        documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/bashcomplete/).
        As an example, here is what to add to your `~/.bashrc` file if you're using bash:
        
        ```bash
        eval "$(_PULP_COMPLETE=source_bash pulp)"
        ```
