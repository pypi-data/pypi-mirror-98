# @seeebiii/ses-email-forwarding

This [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) construct allows you to setup email forwarding mappings in [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) to receive emails from your domain and forward them to another email address.
All of this is possible without hosting your own email server, you just need a domain.

For example, if you own a domain `example.org` and want to receive emails for `hello@example.org` and `privacy@example.org`, you can forward emails to `whatever@provider.com`.
This is achieved by using a Lambda function that forwards the emails using [aws-lambda-ses-forwarder](https://github.com/arithmetric/aws-lambda-ses-forwarder).

This construct is creating quite a few resources under the hood and can also automatically verify your domain and email addresses in SES.
Consider reading the [Architecture](#architecture) section below if you want to know more about the details.

## Examples

Forward all emails received under `hello@example.org` to `whatever+hello@provider.com`:

```javascript
new EmailForwardingRuleSet(this, 'EmailForwardingRuleSet', {
  // make the underlying rule set the active one
  enableRuleSet: true,
  // define how emails are being forwarded
  emailForwardingProps: [{
    // your domain name you want to use for receiving and sending emails
    domainName: 'example.org',
    // a prefix that is used for the From email address to forward your mails
    fromPrefix: 'noreply',
    // a list of mappings between a prefix and target email address
    emailMappings: [{
      // the prefix matching the receiver address as <prefix>@<domainName>
      receivePrefix: 'hello',
      // the target email address(es) that you want to forward emails to
      targetEmails: ['whatever+hello@provider.com']
    }]
  }]
});
```

Forward all emails to `hello@example.org` to `whatever+hello@provider.com` and verify the domain `example.org` in SES:

```javascript
new EmailForwardingRuleSet(this, 'EmailForwardingRuleSet', {
  emailForwardingProps: [{
    domainName: 'example.org',
    // let the construct automatically verify your domain
    verifyDomain: true,
    fromPrefix: 'noreply',
    emailMappings: [{
      receivePrefix: 'hello',
      targetEmails: ['whatever+hello@provider.com']
    }]
  }]
});
```

If you don't want to verify your domain in SES or you are in the SES sandbox, you can still send emails to verified email addresses.
Use the property `verifyTargetEmailAddresses` in this case and set it to `true`.

For a full & up-to-date reference of the available options, please look at the source code of  [`EmailForwardingRuleSet`](lib/email-forwarding-rule-set.ts) and [`EmailForwardingRule`](lib/email-forwarding-rule.ts).

#### Note

Since the verification of domains requires to lookup the Route53 domains in your account, you need to define your AWS account and region.
You can do it like this in your CDK stack:

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
app = cdk.App()

class EmailForwardingSetupStack(cdk.Stack):
    def __init__(self, scope, id, props=None):
        super().__init__(scope, id, props)

        EmailForwardingRuleSet(self, "EmailForwardingRuleSet")

EmailForwardingSetupStack(app, "EmailForwardingSetupStack",
    env={
        "account": "<account-id>",
        "region": "<region>"
    }
)
```

## Use Cases

* Build a landing page on AWS and offer an email address to contact you.
* Use various aliases to register for different services and forward all mails to the same target email address.

There are probably more - happy to hear them :)

## Install

### npm

```shell
npm i -D @seeebiii/ses-email-forwarding
```

Take a look at [package.json](./package.json) to make sure you're installing the correct version compatible with your current AWS CDK version.

## Usage

This package provides two constructs: [`EmailForwardingRuleSet`](lib/email-forwarding-rule-set.ts) and [`EmailForwardingRule`](lib/email-forwarding-rule.ts).
The `EmailForwardingRuleSet` is a wrapper around `ReceiptRuleSet` but adds a bit more magic to e.g. verify a domain or target email address.
Similarly, `EmailForwardingRule` is a wrapper around `ReceiptRule` but adds two SES rule actions to forward the email addresses appropriately.

This means if you want the full flexibility, you can use the `EmailForwardingRule` construct in your stack.

### Sending E-Mails over SMTP

You can also send emails over SES using this construct because it provides the basics for sending emails: a verified SES domain or email address identity.
You need to do the following if you're using the `EmailForwardingRuleSetConstruct`:

1. Set the `verifyDomain` or `verifyTargetEmailAddresses` to `true`.
2. [Create SMTP credentials in AWS SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/smtp-credentials.html?icmpid=docs_ses_console) and save them somewhere.
3. Setup your email program or application to use the SMTP settings.

## Architecture

The `EmailForwardingRuleSet` creates a `EmailForwardingRule` for each forward mapping.
Each rule contains an `S3Action` to store the incoming emails and a Lambda Function to forward the emails to the target email addresses.
The Lambda function is just a thin wrapper around the [aws-lambda-ses-forwarder](https://github.com/arithmetric/aws-lambda-ses-forwarder) library.
Since this library expects a JSON config with the email mappings, the `EmailForwardingRule` will create an SSM parameter to store the config.
(Note: this is not ideal because an SSM parameter is limited in the size and hence, this might be changed later)
The Lambda function receives a reference to this parameter as an environment variable (and a bit more) and forwards everything to the library.

In order to verify a domain or email address, the `EmailForwardingRuleSet` construct is using the package [@seeebiii/ses-verify-identities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@seeebiii/ses-verify-identities).
It provides constructs to verify the SES identities.
For domains, it creates appropriate Route53 records like MX, TXT and Cname (for DKIM).
For email addresses, it calls the AWS API to initiate email address verification.

## TODO

* Encrypt email files on S3 bucket by either using S3 bucket encryption (server side) or enable client encryption using SES actions

## Contributing

I'm happy to receive any contributions!
Just open an issue or pull request :)

These commands should help you while developing:

* `npx projen`             synthesize changes in [.projenrc.js](.projenrc.js) to the project
* `npm run build`          compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`          watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`           perform the jest unit tests
* `npm run lint`           validate code against best practices

## Thanks

Thanks a lot to [arithmetric](https://github.com/arithmetric) for providing the NPM package [aws-lambda-ses-forwarder](https://github.com/arithmetric/aws-lambda-ses-forwarder).
This CDK construct is using it in the Lambda function to forward the emails.
