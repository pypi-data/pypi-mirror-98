Projects that you want to share among several computers or project
workers are today most conveniently stored at some web site "in the
cloud" and updated through communication with that
site. [hpl's semi opinion 1: not sure if in the cloud is
understood by
all.] I strongly recommend you to use such sites for all serious
programming and scientific writing work - and all other important
files.

The simplest services for hosting project files is Dropbox. [mp 2: Simply go to <https://dropbox.com> and watch the video. It explains
how files, like `myfile.py`, perhaps containing much math, like
$\partial u/\partial t$, are easily communicated between machines.] It
is very easy to get started with Dropbox, and it allows you to share
files among [hpl 3: laptops and mobile units -> computers, tablets,
and phones].
