LaTeX Mathematics
=================

Here is an equation without label using backslash-bracket environment:

.. math::
         a = b + c 

or with number and label, as in :ref:`(6) <Eq:my:eq1>`, using the equation environment:

.. _Eq:my:eq1:

.. math::

    \tag{6}
    {\partial u\over\partial t} = \nabla^2 u 
        

We can refer to this equation by :ref:`(6) <Eq:my:eq1>`.

Here is a system without equation numbers, using the align-asterisk environment:

.. math::
        \begin{align*}
        \pmb{a} &= \pmb{q}\times\pmb{n} \\ 
        b &= \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 v
        \end{align*}

And here is a system of equations with labels in an align environment:

.. _Eq:eq1:

.. math::

    \tag{7}
    a = q + 4 + 5+ 6  
        

.. _Eq:eq2:

.. math::

    \tag{8}
    b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x 
        
        

We can refer to :ref:`(7) <Eq:eq1>`-:ref:`(8) <Eq:eq2>`. They are a bit simpler than
the Navier - Stokes equations. And test LaTeX hyphen in ``CG-2``.
Also test :math:`a_{i-j}` as well as :math:`kx-wt`.

Testing ``alignat`` environment:

.. _Eq:eq1a:

.. math::

    \tag{9}
    a = q + 4 + 5+ 6\qquad  \mbox{for } q\geq 0  
        

.. _Eq:eq2a:

.. math::

    \tag{10}
    b = \nabla^2 u + \nabla^4 x  x\in\Omega 
        

More mathematical typesetting is demonstrated in the coming exercises.

Below, we have :ref:`demo:ex:1` and :ref:`demo:ex:2`,
as well as :ref:`proj:circle1` and :ref:`exer:you`, and in
between there we have :ref:`exer:some:formula`.
