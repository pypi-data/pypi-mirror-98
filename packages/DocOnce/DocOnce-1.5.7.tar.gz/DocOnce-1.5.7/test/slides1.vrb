\frametitle{Various admon blocks}

Can use admons to simulate blocks:

\pause
\begin{block}{Key PDE (with large title and math font): }
\large

\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nabla^2 u \]
\end{block}

\pause
\begin{block}{}
Just some block with text and a conclusion that something is important.
This one pops up after the rest of the slide.
\end{block}

\pause
\begin{block}{Warning}
\footnotesize

Can use, e.g., a warning admon to have my own notes, preferably
inside preprocess/mako if statements to turn notes on and off.
This one is typeset in a small font and with the default
title (Warning) since no title is specified.
\end{block}
