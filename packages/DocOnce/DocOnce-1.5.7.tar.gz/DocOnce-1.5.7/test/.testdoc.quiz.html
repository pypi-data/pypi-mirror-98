Given

$$
 \frac{dy}{dx} = -y(x),\quad y(0)=1 
$$
What is the solution of this equation?
<!-- --- end quiz question --- -->
<!-- --- label: quiz:diff:eq1 -->

<!-- --- begin quiz choice 1 (right) --- -->
$y=e^{-y}$
<!-- --- end quiz choice 1 (right) --- -->

<!-- --- begin quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->
$y=e^{y}$
<!-- --- end quiz choice 2 (wrong) --- -->

<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 2 --- -->
Almost, but the sign is wrong (note the minus!).

from math import exp
def f(x):
    return exp(x)

<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 3 --- -->
Ooops, forgot a minus: `exp(-x)`, otherwise this Python code
must be considered as a good answer. It is more natural,
though, to write the solution to the problem
in mathematical notation:

$$
 y(x) = e^{-y}.
$$

<!-- --- begin quiz choice 4 (wrong) --- -->
The solution cannot be found because there is a derivative in the equation.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 4 (wrong) --- -->

<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 4 --- -->
Equations with derivatives can be solved;
they are termed *differential
equations*.
<!-- --- end explanation of choice 4 --- -->

<!-- --- begin quiz choice 5 (wrong) --- -->
The equation is meaningless: an equation must be an equation
for $x$ or $y$, not a function $y(x)$.
<!-- --- end quiz choice 5 (wrong) --- -->

<!-- --- begin explanation of choice 5 --- -->
Equations where the unknown is a function, as $y(x)$
here, are called *differential equations*, and are solved by
special techniques.
