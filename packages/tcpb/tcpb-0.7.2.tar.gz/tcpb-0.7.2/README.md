# Python TeraChem Protocol Buffer (TCPB) Client

Python client to communicate with TeraChem running in server mode.

Client uses C-style sockets for communication and Protocol Buffers for data serialization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+

## Installation

```sh
pip install tcpb
```

## Notes

The original, Python 2.7 compatible `tcpb` client built by Stefan Seritan was released as version `0.6.0`. If you depend upon this original release it can be installed by pegging to its version:

```sh
pip install tcpb==0.6.0
```

All future releases will support Python 3+ and MolSSI's QCSchema for data input/output.
