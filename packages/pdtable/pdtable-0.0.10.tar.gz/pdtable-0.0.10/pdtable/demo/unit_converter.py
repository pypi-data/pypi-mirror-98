    A simple unit converter that hasn't read a lot of books.

    This is an example of how the user could implement a unit converting function.
    Here we define a few unit conversions manually. But the user could also choose to just
    delegate this to some dedicated unit support package like 'pint' or 'unum' or whatever.
    As long as everything is wrapped in a function with the same signature as this one.

    Args:
        value:
            A number or array of numbers. Arrays must support math operators and functions
            operating on it element-wise.
        from_unit:
            Old unit
        to_unit:
            New unit to which to convert

    Returns:
        Number or array converted from old to new unit.
