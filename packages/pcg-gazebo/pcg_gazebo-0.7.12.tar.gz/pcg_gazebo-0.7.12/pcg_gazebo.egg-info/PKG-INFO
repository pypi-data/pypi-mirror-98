        The ``pcg_gazebo`` Python package is an Open Source Project extending
        the simulation capabilities of the robotics simulator
        `Gazebo <http://gazebosim.org/>`__ for automation and scripting of
        Gazebo simulations.
        
        Visit the `documentation
        page <https://boschresearch.github.io/pcg_gazebo/>`__ for more
        information.
        
        Purpose of the project
        ----------------------
        
        This software is a research prototype.
        
        The software is not ready for production use. It has neither been
        developed nor tested for a specific use case. However, the license
        conditions of the applicable Open Source licenses allow you to adapt the
        software to your needs. Before using it in a safety relevant setting,
        make sure that the software fulfills your requirements and adjust it
        according to any applicable safety standards (e.g. ISO 26262).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using ``pip``
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can install the ``pcg-gazebo`` package using ``pip`` as follows
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install pcg-gazebo
        
        you still might need to install some extra dependencies that cannot be
        handled by ``pip`` as
        
        ::
        
           sudo apt install libspatialindex-dev pybind11-dev libgeos-dev
        
        Give some issues with the package ``rtree`` on ``pip``, it would also be
        recommended to install it from ``apt``. Please install ``python-rtree``
        if you are using Python 2.x or ``python3-rtree`` for Python 3.x.
        
           The default installation does not include ``rospy`` dependencies that
           are not available as a ``pip`` package. They have to be installed
           separately for certain submodules to work, such as
           ``pcg_gazebo.task_manager``.
        
        From source
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        First install some non-Python dependencies
        
        ::
        
           sudo apt install libspatialindex-dev pybind11-dev libgeos-dev libfcl-dev liboctomap-dev
        
        Then clone the repository and install it using ``pip``
        
        ::
        
           git clone https://github.com/boschresearch/pcg_gazebo.git
           cd pcg_gazebo
           pip install .
        
        Using the package with ROS and Gazebo
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Certain functionalities as the Gazebo proxy, task manager and model
        spawning are only available if ``rospy`` is installed. The lack of
        Gazebo and ``rospy`` only restricts functionalities related to
        interaction with the simulation in runtime and the creation of
        ROS-related tasks.
        
        At the moment, ROS 2 is **not** supported for this purpose. To install
        ROS ``melodic``, follow these `installation
        instructions <https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu>`__ and
        install ``ros-melodic-desktop-full`` or separately install Gazebo and
        its ROS bindings as
        
        ::
        
           sudo apt install gazebo9 libgazebo9-dev ros-melodic-gazebo-*
