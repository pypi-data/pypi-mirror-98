# A map is a grid of tiles defined at the bottom
# of the file starting in the "map:" section.
# The tiles are:
#   A..Z    Tiles A through Z
#   @       Start
#   *       Beacon
#
# Additional tiles can be added at the "extra:" section.
# These definitions have the form: [basename]@[x],[y].
#
#
# Paint strokes kan be added in the "paint:" section
# by adding tuples of the form: ([color],[type],[x],[y])
# [color] :   w = white
#             b = black
# [type]  :   . = single dot
#             - = horizontal stroke to the right
#             | = vertical stroke down
# [x]     :   integer horizontal position
# [y]     :   integer vertical position
