        Installing Textoter
        ===================
        Dependencies
        ------------
        Textoter is a Gnome application, written in Python. It uses bluez stack /via/ DBus. The contacts are parsed using `vobject`.
        To detect phone capabilities, textoter uses `sdptool` from `bluez` package.
        
        Install
        -------
        First you may need to install dependencies, for instance on Debian derivatives:
        
            apt-get install bluez gnome-bluetooth python3-vobject python3-gi
        
        And then textoter:
        
            pip install textoter
        
        User interface
        ==============
        To be detected by Textoter, your phone should have been connected at least one time with the computer using the [GNOME's Bluetooth interface](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/bluetooth-connect-device.html.en).
        
        Starting Textoter
        -----------------
        From GNOME Shell, start to type in the search bar `textoter` and click when it appears.
        
        From command line launch Textoter with:
        
            textoter
        
        Phone selection
        --------------
        On startup Textoter detects the available phones and list them in `Devices`.
        Select the phone from this drop-down list.
        
        Recipient
        ---------
        To define the recipient, either:
        * type directly the phone number in the `To :` field, preferrably in international format `+123456789`
        * Use phone's contacts
        
        For the latter:
        * load the phone contacts by clicking on the `phone` icon-button. Depending on your phone settigs, you may have to confirm that the computer can access phone's contacts.
        * select in the drop-down list the contact. You can also type the contact name and Textoter will propose a list of possible completions.
        
        Message
        -------
        Type the message in the text area under `Message`.
        
        Send
        ----
        Click on the `Send` button. Textoter then transmit the message to the phone. Depending on your phone, you will have to confirm that the computer can access phone messages.
        
        Quit
        ----
        Click on `Quit` button. Textoter then save the current phone and exits.
        On subsequent launch, textoter will reuse the last phone selected.
