		Windows users may download the :download:`CHM Manual <../guiqwt.chm.zip>`.

		After downloading this file, you may see blank pages in the documentation. 
		That's because Windows is blocking CHM files for security reasons. 
		Fixing this problem is easy:

			* Right-click the CHM file, select properties, then click “Unblock”.
			* Or compress the CHM file into a zip archive and decompress it in 
			  another directory.
			* Do not open the CHM file on a network drive.
