    Don't write to this file anymore!!

    Buildbot now uses towncrier to manage its release notes.
    towncrier helps to avoid the need for rebase when several people work at the same time on the releasenote files.

    Each PR should come with a file in the master/buildbot/newsfragment directory

Buildbot ``3.0.0`` ( ``2021-03-08`` )
=====================================

This release includes all changes up to Buildbot ``2.10.2``.

Bug fixes
---------

- Avatar caching is now working properly and size argument is now handled correctly.
- Removed display of hidden steps in the build summary tooltip.
- ``GitHubPullrequestPoller`` now supports secrets in its ``token`` argument (:issue:`4921`)
- Plugin database will no longer issue warnings on load, but only when a particular entry is accessed.
- SSH connections are now run with ``-o BatchMode=yes`` to prevent interactive prompts which may tie up a step, reporter or change source until it times out.

Features
--------

- ``BitbucketPullrequestPoller``, ``BitbucketCloudEventHandler``, ``BitbucketServerEventHandler`` were enhanced to save PR entries matching provided masks as build properties.
- ``BitbucketPullrequestPoller`` has been enhanced to optionally authorize Bitbucket API.
- Added `pullrequesturl` property to the following pollers and change hooks: ``BitbucketPullrequestPoller``, ``GitHubPullrequestPoller``, ``GitHubEventHandler``.
  This unifies all Bitbucket and GitHub pollers with the shared property interface.
- AvatarGitHub class has been enhanced to handle avatar based on email requests and take size argument into account
- Added support for Fossil user objects for use by the buildbot-fossil plugin.
- A new ``www.ws_ping_interval`` configuration option was added to avoid websocket timeouts when using reverse proxies and CDNs (:issue:`4078`)
