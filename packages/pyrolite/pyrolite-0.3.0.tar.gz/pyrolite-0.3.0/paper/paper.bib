  abstract = {Advances in analytical geochemistry have made it possible to determine precisely the concentration of many trace elements and their isotopes in rocks. These data provide the cornerstone for geochemical models of the Earth and terrestrial planets. However, our understanding of how trace elements behave has not kept pace with the analytical advances. As a result, geochemists are often hampered in their interpretation of geochemical data by an incomplete knowledge of trace element partitioning under the conditions of interest. Through advances in trace element microbeam analysis it is now possible to determine partition coefficients experimentally under important conditions, such as during melting of the crust and mantle. This large body of experimental data can be used to investigate the fundamental controls on element partitioning. Simple continuum theories of elastic strain and point charges in crystal lattices, that account, respectively, for mismatch in ionic radius and ionic charge between the substituent trace ion and the lattice site on which it is accommodated, provide a very useful theoretical framework. This approach can be used as the basis for quantitative models of trace element partitioning, in terms of pressure, temperature, redox state and composition, and as a means of predicting partition coefficients for elements not routinely analysed. Experimental studies of partitioning are supported by atomistic computer simulations at zero K. Developments in computational techniques that enable direct simulation of high temperature and pressure mineral-melt partitioning will revolutionise the field in the near future. Use of novel, spectroscopic techniques to probe the structural environment of trace elements in crystals and glasses will provide valuable new data for computational and theoretical models. Extension of high temperature partitioning theory to ambient conditions is an essential step in understanding current climate change proxies, and tackling a host of environmental problems.},

It covers the subject in greater depth, and it reflects some significant changes in the author's views since the writing of the earlier paper. In particular, the spatial range of equilibrium attained during partial melting may be much smaller than previously thought, because of new experimental diffusion data and new results from natural settings. Also, the question of `layered' versus `whole-mantle' convection, including the depth of subduction and of the origin of plumes, has to be reassessed in light of the recent breakthroughs achieved by seismic mantle tomography. As the spatial resolution of seismic tomography and the pressure range, accuracy, and precision of experimental data on melting relations, phase transformations, and kinetics continue to improve, the interaction between these disciplines and geochemistry sensu stricto will continue to improve our understanding of what is actually going on in the mantle. The established views of the mantle being engaged in simple two- or single-layer convection are becoming obsolete. In many ways, we are just at the beginning of this new phase of mantle geology, geophysics, and geochemistry.},

One of the principal constraints on the positioning of the boundaries between the various named fields was to minimize the degree of overlap between adjacent fields.},

  abstract = {The customary practice for displaying REE abundances is to normalize them to chondritic abundances and then to plot these normalized abundances in order of atomic number, Z , although the 3 + ionic radius, rREE , is proposed here as a preferable independent variable. In basalts, the resulting CI-normalized REE patterns usually appear smooth (excepting Eu), such that they may be fitted to polynomials in rREE with three to five terms, depending on analytical precision. The polynomials can be rearranged into an orthogonal form:  ln([REE]/[REE] CI )={$\lambda$} 0 +{$\lambda$} 1f1orth +{$\lambda$} 2f2orth +\ldots{}  where f1orth , f2orth , etc. are themselves polynomials of rREE , chosen such that the coefficients {$\lambda$} 0 , {$\lambda$} 1 , {$\lambda$} 2 , etc. are not correlated with each other. The terms have a simple, intuitive meaning: {$\lambda$} 0 is the average of the logarithms of the CI-normalized REE abundances; the term in f1orth describes the linear slope of the pattern; that in f2orth describes the quadratic curvature, etc. For most basalts, fits using only three terms ({$\lambda$} 0 , {$\lambda$} 1 , and {$\lambda$} 2 ) capture REE patterns to better than {$\pm$}5\%. The {$\lambda$} n , called the `shape coefficients', can be used to compare the shapes of CI-normalized REE patterns quantitatively, allowing large numbers of data to be assessed, revealing trends not evident from studies of single localities. Especially instructive are {$\lambda$} 2 vs {$\lambda$} 1 diagrams. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated using the REE patterns of common types of basalts from (mainly) oceanic settings: ocean floor basalts (OFB), ocean island basalts (OIB), and some convergent margin basalts. It is shown that the global population of OFB is characterized by a narrow dispersion of {$\lambda$} 0 at a given MgO content, but with large variations of {$\lambda$} 1 and {$\lambda$} 2 . Convergent margin basalts have much greater variation of {$\lambda$} 0 at a given [MgO], but most plot in the same area of the {$\lambda$} 2 vs {$\lambda$} 1 diagram. OIB are well separated from the OFB global array on this diagram, with Hawaiian shield basalts occupying a unique area. Because REE mineral/melt partition coefficients are also smooth functions of rREE , many mass-balance equations for petrogenetic processes that relate observed concentrations to initial concentrations, [REE] o , such as batch or fractional melting, or crystallization, may be fitted to the same orthogonal polynomials:  ln([REE]/[REE] o )={$\psi$} 0 +{$\psi$} 1f1orth +{$\psi$} 2f2orth +\ldots{} .  The orthogonality ensures that all {$\lambda$} n and {$\psi$} n terms of the same order n sum independently of the terms of the other orders, such that {$\lambda$} n = {$\lambda$}n0 + {$\psi$} n , where {$\lambda$}n0 is the shape coefficient of the source or parent magma. On {$\lambda$} 2 vs {$\lambda$} 1 diagrams, this approach can be used to relate the shapes of patterns in parental basalts to the shapes of the patterns of their sources, or differentiated basalts to their parental melts, by means of `petrogenetic process vectors' consisting of the {$\psi$} 1 and {$\psi$} 2 terms, which plot as vectors on the {$\lambda$} 2 vs {$\lambda$} 1 diagrams. For example, the difference between OIB and the global array of OFB can be shown to be due to garnet in the sources of OIB. The global array of OFB requires a remarkably constant degree of partial melting ( F ) of a source with constant {$\lambda$} 0 to produce their parental magmas, or a compensating correlation between F and source {$\lambda$} 0 . Assuming a constant source, with previously suggested depleted mantle compositions, F is {$\sim$}19\%, with the standard deviation of the population being only 2\%. Hawaiian shield tholeiites may be products of 1\textendash{}2\% melting at substantially higher pressures, perhaps straddling the garnet-to-spinel transition, of a source with REE patterns near the median of the REE patterns of OFB sources. Other OIB are the result of lower degrees of melting, usually of more light REE-enriched sources.},

Trace-element data for mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) and ocean island basalts (OIB) are used to formulate chemical systematics for oceanic basalts. The data suggest that the order of trace-element incompatibility in oceanic basalts is Cs {$\approx$} Rb {$\approx$} ({$\approx$} Tl) {$\approx$} Ba({$\approx$} W) {$>$} Th {$>$} U {$\approx$} Nb = Ta {$\approx$} K {$>$} La {$>$} Ce {$\approx$} Pb {$>$} Pr ({$\approx$} Mo) {$\approx$} Sr {$>$} P {$\approx$} Nd ({$>$} F) {$>$} Zr = Hf {$\approx$} Sm {$>$} Eu {$\approx$} Sn ({$\approx$} Sb) {$\approx$} Ti {$>$} Dy {$\approx$} (Li) {$>$} Ho = Y {$>$} Yb. This rule works in general and suggests that the overall fractionation processes operating during magma generation and evolution are relatively simple, involving no significant change in the environment of formation for MORBs and OIBs.
In detail, minor differences in element ratios correlate with the isotopic characteristics of different types of OIB components (HIMU, EM, MORB). These systematics are interpreted in terms of partial-melting conditions, variations in residual mineralogy, involvement of subducted sediment, recycling of oceanic lithosphere and processes within the low velocity zone. Niobium data indicate that the mantle sources of MORB and OIB are not exact complementary reservoirs to the continental crust. Subduction of oceanic crust or separation of refractory eclogite material from the former oceanic crust into the lower mantle appears to be required. The negative europium anomalies observed in some EM-type OIBs and the systematics of their key element ratios suggest the addition of a small amount ({$\leqslant$}1\% or less) of subducted sediment to their mantle sources. However, a general lack of a crustal signature in OIBs indicates that sediment recycling has not been an important process in the convecting mantle, at least not in more recent times ({$\leqslant$}2 Ga). Upward migration of silica-undersaturated melts from the low velocity zone can generate an enriched reservoir in the continental and oceanic lithospheric mantle. We propose that the HIMU type (eg St Helena) OIB component can be generated in this way. This enriched mantle can be re-introduced into the convective mantle by thermal erosion of the continental lithosphere and by the recycling of the enriched oceanic lithosphere back into the mantle.},
