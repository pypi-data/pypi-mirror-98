fixes:
  - Fix the creation issue when special meanings words in queue name.
    When using zaqarclient to create a queue with some special
    meanings words like "#" and "%", then cli will return the queue
    with the name has created successfully, but in zaqar server side,
    the name is not as same as the client side.
    Add the check for some special meanings words, it will raise error message
    when using those words in queue name.
