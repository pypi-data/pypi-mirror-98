====================================================
Welcome to the Zaqar-client developer documentation!
====================================================

`Zaqar`_ is a multi-tenant cloud messaging and notification service for web
and mobile developers.

The service features a ReST API, which developers can use to send messages
between various components of their SaaS and mobile applications, by using a
variety of communication patterns. Underlying this API is an efficient
messaging engine designed with scalability and security in mind.

Other OpenStack components can integrate with Zaqar to surface events to
end users and to communicate with guest agents that run in the
"over-cloud" layer.

.. note:: This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the Zaqar project source
   tree. Additional draft and project documentation regarding Zaqar and other components of OpenStack can
   be found on the `OpenStack Wiki`_, as well as in the user guides found on `docs.openstack.org`_.
