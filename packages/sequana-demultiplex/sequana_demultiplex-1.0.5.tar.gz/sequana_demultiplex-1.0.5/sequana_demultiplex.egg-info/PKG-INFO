        This is is the **demultiplex** pipeline from the `Sequana <https://sequana.readthedocs.org>`_ projet
        
        :Overview: Runs bcl2fastq on raw BCL data and creates plots to ease the QC validation
        :Input: A valid Illumina base calling directory
        :Output: An HTML report, a set of PNG files and the expected FastQ files
        :Status: production

        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You must install Sequana first::
        
            pip install sequana
        
        Then, just install this package::
        
            pip install sequana_demultiplex
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            sequana_pipelines_demultiplex --help
            sequana_pipelines_demultiplex --working-directory DATAPATH --bcl-directory bcldata --sample-sheet SampleSheet.csv --merging-strategy merge
        
        The bcl-directory option indicate where to find your raw data, the sample-sheet
        expects the SampleSheet compatible with IEM software. The merging--strategy can
        be set to *none* or *merge*. The *merge* option merge the lanes. For NextSeq
        sequencers.
        
        This creates a directory **fastq**. You just need to execute the pipeline::
        
            cd demultiplex
            sh demultiplex.sh  # for a local run
        
        This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can retrieve the demultiplex.rules and config.yaml files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::
        
            snakemake -s demultiplex.rules --cores 4 --stats stats.txt
        
        Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html>`_ interface.
        
        Would you need to merge the lane, please add the --merging-strategy argument
        followed by *merge*::
        
            sequana_pipelines_demultiplex --bcl-directory bcl_data --merging-strategy merge --sample-sheet SampleSheet.csv
        
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This pipelines requires the following third-party tool(s):
        
        - bcl2fastq 2.20.0
        
        This software has an end-user license agreement (EULA). Given the EULA details
        of this software, it cannot be distributed by us but only by Illumina.
        Therefore, you should install it yourself. On cluster facility, you may ask to
        your system administator. For instance::
        
            module load bcl2fastq/2.20.0
        
        For the same reason you cannot find it on community such as bioconda or docker (aug 2020).
        
        So, you will need to download the code yourself. The easiest is to download the
        RPM from `Illumina
        <https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software/downloads.html>`_
        and accept the agreements. Install it using the RPM if you have a debian-like system::
        
            rpm install file.rpm
        
        If you do not have a debian system, you can look at https://damona.readthedocs.io where we provide
        a singularity recipes to build an image from your own  rpm. Recipes can be found
        `here <https://github.com/cokelaer/damona/tree/master/damona/recipes/bcl2fastq>`_.

        This pipeline runs bcl2fastq 2.20 and creates a set of diagnostics plots to help
        deciphering common issues such as missing index and sample sheet errors. 
        
        
        Rules and configuration details
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here is the `latest documented configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/demultiplex/master/sequana_pipelines/demultiplex/config.yaml>`_
        to be used with the pipeline. Each rule used in the pipeline may have a section in the configuration file.

        ========= =======================================================================
        Version   Description
        ========= =======================================================================
        1.0.5     * Fix regression bug to cope with new snakemake API
                  * Compatibility with sequanix GUI
        1.0.4     * Better HTML report with updated images. 
                  * validate the SampleSheet when using sequana_demultiplex and/or the 
                    pipeline
                  * Add error handler from sequana_pipetools
                  * save all undetermined barcodes (not just first 20)
                  * No changes to the UI
                  * technically, the input_directory option is now in a section so that
                    it can be used in Sequanix
        1.0.3     * remove check_samplesheet and fix_samplesheet modules now in sequana
                  * check sample sheet but do not fail. Instead, informing users that
                    there is an error and suggest to use 'sequana samplesheet 
                    --quick-fix'
        1.0.2     Use 'sequana samplesheet --check ' command instead of deprecated
                  sequana_check_sample_sheet command
        1.0.1     change some default behaviour:
        
                  * write_fastq_reverse_complement is now set to False by default
                    like bcl2fastq
                  * The --no-bgzf-compression option is changed into
                    --bgzf-compression. We do not want this option by default.
                  * The --ignore-missing-bcls option is changed into
                    --no-ignore-missing-bcls so as to ignore missing bcls by default
                    keep this option as a flag and keep same behaviour
                  * Fix HTML syntax 
        1.0.0     * stable version pinned on sequana libraries
        0.9.11    * fix label in plot_summary, 
                  * add new plot to show reads per sample + undetermined
                  * add two tools one to check the samplesheet called 
                    sequana_sample_sheet and one called sequana_fix_samplesheet. The 
                    former is now inside the pipeline as well and when creating the
                    pipeline
                  * set --write_reverse_complement to False by default
                  * remove the --ignore-missing-control which is deprecated anyway
        0.9.10    * implement the new option --from-project, add missing MANIFEST
        0.9.9     * simplification of the pipeline to use sequana 0.8.4 to speed up 
                    the --help calls.
                  * include a summary HTML report 
        0.9.8     * fix typos
        0.9.7     * Use new release of sequana_pipetools
                  * set matplotlib backend to agg
                  * include a simple HTML report
        0.9.6     * Handle different RunParameter.xml name (NextSeq vs HiSeq)
        0.9.5     * Fix a regression bug due to new sequana release. We do not check 
                    the input file (fastq) since this is not a sequence analysis
                    pipeline
                  * Check whether it is a NextSeq run. If so, merging-strategy must be
                    set to 'merge'. Can be bypassed using --force
        0.9.4     * Check the presence of the bcl input directory and samplesheet. 
                  * More help in the --help message. 
                  * add  --sample-sheet option to replace --samplesheet option
                  * Fix the schema file
                  * Check for presence of RunParameters.xml and provide information
                    if merging-stratgy is set to None whereas it is a NextSeq run
        0.9.3     Fix regression bug
        0.9.2     remove warning due to relative paths. 
        0.9.1     Make the merging options compulsory. Users must tell whether they 
                  want to merge the lanes or not. This avoid to do the merging or not 
                  whereas the inverse was expected.
        0.8.6     Uses 64G/biomics queue and 16 cores on a SLURM scheduler
