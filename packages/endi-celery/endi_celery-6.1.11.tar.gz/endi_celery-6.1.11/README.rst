enDI asynchronous tasks
============================

Since version 6, endi-celery only supports python 3.

Asynchronous tasks are executed through celery.
pyramid_celery is used to integrate celery with the Pyramid related stuff.
pyramid_beaker is used to cache responses.

tasks:

    Asynchronous tasks called from enDI

scheduler:

    Beat tasks, repeated along the time (like cron tasks)

Results
-------

No result backend is used, tasks interact directly with enDI's database to
return datas.

enDI celery provides all the models that should be used to store task
execution related stuff (see endi_celery.models).

Install
-------

System packages

    git clone https://framagit.org/endi/endi_celery.git
    cd endi_celery
    python setup.py install
    cp development.ini.sample development.ini

Customize the development.ini file as needed

---------

Launch the following command to launch the worker daemon::

    celery worker -A pyramid_celery.celery_app --ini development.ini
