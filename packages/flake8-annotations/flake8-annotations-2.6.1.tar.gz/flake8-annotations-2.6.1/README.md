`flake8-annotations` is a plugin for [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) that detects the absence of [PEP 3107-style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/) function annotations and [PEP 484-style](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#type-comments) type comments (see: [Caveats](#Caveats-for-PEP-484-style-Type-Comments)).

What this won't do: Check variable annotations (see: [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/)), respect stub files, or replace [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).

## Installation
Install from PyPi with your favorite `pip` invocation:

```bash
$ pip install flake8-annotations
```

It will then be run automatically as part of flake8.

You can verify it's being picked up by invoking the following in your shell:

```bash
$ flake8 --version
3.9.0 (flake8-annotations: 2.6.1, mccabe: 0.6.1, pycodestyle: 2.7.0, pyflakes: 2.3.0) CPython 3.9.1 on Darwin
```

**Notes:**
1. See: [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#annotating-instance-and-class-methods) and [PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/) for suggestions on annotating `self` and `cls` arguments.

## Configuration Options
Some opinionated flags are provided to tailor the linting errors emitted.

### `--suppress-none-returning`: `bool`
Suppress `ANN200`-level errors for functions that meet one of the following criteria:
  * Contain no `return` statement, or
  * Explicit `return` statement(s) all return `None` (explicitly or implicitly).

Default: `False`

### `--suppress-dummy-args`: `bool`
Suppress `ANN000`-level errors for dummy arguments, defined as `_`.

Default: `False`

### `--allow-untyped-defs`: `bool`
Suppress all errors for dynamically typed functions. A function is considered dynamically typed if it does not contain any type hints.

Default: `False`

### `--allow-untyped-nested`: `bool`
Suppress all errors for dynamically typed nested functions. A function is considered dynamically typed if it does not contain any type hints.

Default: `False`

### `--mypy-init-return`: `bool`
Allow omission of a return type hint for `__init__` if at least one argument is annotated. See [mypy's documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/class_basics.html?#annotating-init-methods) for additional details.

Default: `False`

### `--dispatch-decorators`: `list[str]`
Comma-separated list of decorators flake8-annotations should consider as dispatch decorators. Linting errors are suppressed for functions decorated with at least one of these functions.

Decorators are matched based on their attribute name. For example, `"singledispatch"` will match any of the following:
  * `import functools; @functools.singledispatch`
  * `import functools as fnctls; @fnctls.singledispatch`
  * `from functools import singledispatch; @singledispatch`

**NOTE:** Deeper imports, such as `a.b.singledispatch` are not supported.

See: [Generic Functions](#generic-functions) for additional information.

Default: `"singledispatch, singledispatchmethod"`

### `--overload-decorators`: `list[str]`
Comma-separated list of decorators flake8-annotations should consider as [`typing.overload`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.overload) decorators.

Decorators are matched based on their attribute name. For example, `"overload"` will match any of the following:
  * `import typing; @typing.overload`
  * `import typing as t; @t.overload`
  * `from typing import overload; @overload`

**NOTE:** Deeper imports, such as `a.b.overload` are not supported.

See: [The `typing.overload` Decorator](#the-typingoverload-decorator) for additional information.

Default: `"overload"`


## Generic Functions
Per the Python Glossary, a [generic function](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generic-function) is defined as:

> A function composed of multiple functions implementing the same operation for different types. Which implementation should be used during a call is determined by the dispatch algorithm.

In the standard library we have some examples of decorators for implementing these generic functions: [`functools.singledispatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch) and [`functools.singledispatchmethod`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatchmethod). In the spirit of the purpose of these decorators, errors for missing annotations for functions decorated with at least one of these are ignored.

For example, this code:

```py
import functools

@functools.singledispatch
def foo(a):
    print(a)

@foo.register
def _(a: list) -> None:
    for idx, thing in enumerate(a):
        print(idx, thing)
```

Will not raise any linting errors for `foo`.

Decorator(s) to treat as defining generic functions may be specified by the [`--dispatch-decorators`](#--dispatch-decorators-liststr) configuration option.

## The `typing.overload` Decorator
Per the [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.overload) documentation:

> The `@overload` decorator allows describing functions and methods that support multiple different combinations of argument types. A series of `@overload`-decorated definitions must be followed by exactly one non-`@overload`-decorated definition (for the same function/method).

In the spirit of the purpose of this decorator, errors for missing annotations for non-`@overload`-decorated functions are ignored if they meet this criteria.

For example, this code:

```py
import typing


@typing.overload
def foo(a: int) -> int:
    ...

def foo(a):
    ...
```

Will not raise linting errors for missing annotations for the arguments & return of the non-decorated `foo` definition.

Decorator(s) to treat as `typing.overload` may be specified by the [`--overload-decorators`](#--overload-decorators-liststr) configuration option.

## Caveats for PEP 484-style Type Comments

### Mixing argument-level and function-level type comments
Support is provided for mixing argument-level and function-level type comments.

```py
def foo(
    arg1,  # type: bool
    arg2,  # type: bool
):  # type: (...) -> bool
    pass
```

**Note:** If present, function-level type comments will override any argument-level type comments.

### Partial type comments
Partially type hinted functions are supported for non-static class methods.

For example:

```py
class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        # type: () -> None
        ...

    def bar(self, a):
        # type: (int) -> int
        ...
```
Will consider `bar`'s `self` argument as unannotated and use the `int` type hint for `a`.

Partial type comments utilizing ellipses as placeholders is also supported:

```py
def foo(arg1, arg2):
    # type: (bool) -> bool
    pass
```
Will show `arg2` as missing a type hint.

```py
def foo(arg1, arg2):
    # type: (..., bool) -> bool
    pass
```
Will show `arg1` as missing a type hint.

**Deprecation notice**: Explicit support for utilization of ellipses as placeholders will be removed in version `3.0`. See [this issue](https://github.com/sco1/flake8-annotations/issues/95) for more information.

## Contributing

### Development Environment
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies. With your fork cloned to your local machine, you can install the project and its dependencies to create a development environment using:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

Note: An editable installation of `flake8-annotations` in the developer environment is required in order for the plugin to be registered for Flake8. By default, Poetry includes an editable install of the project itself when `poetry install` is invoked.

A [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) configuration is also provided to create a pre-commit hook so linting errors aren't committed:

```bash
$ pre-commit install
```

### Testing & Coverage
A [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) suite is provided, with coverage reporting from [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov). A [tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/) configuration is provided to test across all supported versions of Python. Testing will be skipped for Python versions that cannot be found.

```bash
$ tox
```

Details on missing coverage, including in the test suite, is provided in the report to allow the user to generate additional tests for full coverage.
