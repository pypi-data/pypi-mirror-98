def parallel_map(
    work_func: Callable,
    *sequences: Iterable,
    **kwargs: Any
) -> "ParallelResultsIterator":
    """
    Generalized local parallelization helper for executing embarrassingly
    parallel functions on an iterable of input data. This function then yields
    work results for data, optionally in the order that they were provided to
    this function.

    By default, we act like ``itertools.izip`` in regards to input sequences,
    whereby we stop performing work as soon as one of the input sequences is
    exhausted. The optional keyword argument ``fill_void`` may be specified to
    enable sequence handling like ``itertools.zip_longest`` where the longest
    sequence determines what is iterated, and the value given to ``fill_void``
    is used as the fill value.

    This is intended to be able to replace ``multiprocessing.pool.Pool`` and
    ``multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool`` uses with the added benefit of:
        - No set-up or clean-up needed
        - No performance loss compared to ``multiprocessing.pool`` classes
          for non-trivial work functions (like IO operations).
        - We can iterate results as they are ready (optionally in order of
          input)
        - Lambda or on-the-fly function can be provided as the work function
          when using multiprocessing.
        - Buffered input/output queues so that mapping work of a very large
          input set doesn't overrun your memory (e.g. iterating over many large
          vectors/matrices).

    This function is, however, slower than multiprocessing.pool classes for
    trivial functions, like using the function ``ord`` over a set of
    characters.

    Input data given to ``sequences`` must be picklable in order to transport
    to worker threads/processes.

    Input Iteration and Results Buffering
    -------------------------------------
    The buffer factor, ``F``, operates with the number of utilized cores,
    ``C``, to create an upper bound on the times the input sequences are
    iterated and the number of work function outputs are held in memory at any
    given time.

    The maximum number of input sequence items loaded at a time is
    ``floor(C * F) + C``.
    This is due to the input work queue ``maxsize`` being set to ``floor(C*F)``
    while there can be ``C`` workers could be utilizing their inputs to
    complete their work instances.

    The maximum number of results queued is ``floor(C * F) + C``.
    This is similarly due to the output result queue maxsize being set to
    ``floor(C * F)`` while there can be ``C`` workers blocked on putting values
    into a full results queue.

    Sometimes its important to know how much farther ahead the input
    iterator(s) have yielded compared to the number of output results from the
    ``ParallelResultsIterator``.
    For some yielded result at index ``N``, the input iterator(s) next yielded
    item should be their index ``N + (2 * floor(C * F) + C)``. This is
    derived from the input work and output result queues maximally filled with
    at most ``floor(C * F)`` items and there being ``C`` workers working on, or
    attempting to queue results for, their current inputs.
    For example, if we have use ``C=4`` and ``F=1.5``, if result index N has just
    been yielded, then the input iterators are ready to yield their
    ``N + 16``-th indexed item (``2 * floor(4*1.5) + 4 = 2 * 6 + 4 = 16``).

    The above is only guaranteed no the ``ordered`` option is ``False``,
    otherwise non-determinism in processing order can cause results for input
    items to return out of order, causing additional buffering in the heap used
    to ensure ordered output which, necessarily, has no size limits so as to
    not dead-lock.

    :param work_func:
        Function that performs some work on input data, resulting in some
        returned value.

        When in multiprocessing mode, this cannot be a local function or a
        transport error will occur when trying to move the function to the
        worker process.
    :param sequences: Input data to apply to the given ``work_func`` function.
        If more than one sequence is given, the function is called with an
        argument list consisting of the corresponding item of each sequence.
        While we expect Iterable types to be provided here, they will only be
        observed by `zip`/`zip_longest` at most once. See iteration rules for
        `zip`/`zip_longest` for details.
    :param kwargs: Optionally available keyword arguments are as follows:

        - fill_void
            - Optional value that, if specified, activates sequence handling
              like that of ``itertools.zip_longest``, using the provided value
              as a fill-in for shorter sequences until the longest sequence is
              exhausted.
            - type: Any
            - default: No default

        - ordered
            - If results for input elements should be yielded in the same order
              as input elements. If False, we yield results as soon as they are
              collected.
            - type: bool
            - default: True

        - buffer_factor
            - Multiplier against the number of processes used to limit the
              growth size of the result queue coming from worker processes
              (``int(cores * buffer_factor)``). This is utilized so we don't
              overrun our RAM buffering results.
            - type: float
            - default: 2.0

        - cores
            - Optional specification of the number of threads/cores to use. If
              None, we will attempt to use all available threads/cores.
            - type: None | int | long
            - default: None

        - use_multiprocessing
            - Whether or not to use discrete processes as the parallelization
              agent vs python threads.
            - type: bool
            - default: False

        - heart_beat
            - Interval at which workers check for operational messages while
              waiting on locks (e.g. waiting to push or pull messages). This
              ensures that workers are not left hanging, or hang the program,
              when and error or interruption occurs, or when waiting on an full
              edge. This must be >0.
            - type: float
            - default: 0.001

        - name
            - Optional string name for identifying workers and logging
              messages. ``None`` means no names are added.
            - type: str
            - default: None

        - daemon
            - Optional flag for if started threads/processes are flagged as
              daemonic. This is should probably nearly always be True (the
              default) otherwise related threads/processes can hang the main
              process.
            - type: bool
            - default: True

    :return: A new parallel results iterator that starts work on the input
        iterable when iterated.
