## Introduction

The Pipeline is a generic web request intelligence and data processing solution with the ability to add a range of 51Degrees and/or custom plug ins (Engines) 

## This package fiftyone_pipeline_engines

This package extends the `flow element` class created by the `fiftyone.pipeline.core` package into a specialized type of flow element called an engine. This allows for additional features including:

* An auto-updating data file for properties
* A service called when a requested property
* A caching system and implementation of an LRU (least recently used) cache
