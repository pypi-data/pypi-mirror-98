Update Invoice's Due Date
=========================

This module adds a wizard in the invoice menu to allow updating the invoice
due date (Even if the invoice state is done).

When this wizard is used, the invoice's due date is updated, along with the
journal entry.

To be able to use this wizard, the user needs to have access to the group
``Allow to change due date`` in the user.
