Supersolids
===========
Package to simulate and animate supersolids.
This is done by solving the dimensionless time-dependent
non-linear Schrodinger equation for an arbitrary potential.
The split operator method with the Trotter-Suzuki approximation is used.

Documentation

Installing
----------
For the animation to work, **ffmpeg** needs to be installed on your system.

For **python3.9** currently there is no vtk wheel for python3.9, so you need to build it from source or use my build:
* git clone https://github.com/Scheiermann/vtk_python39_wheel.
* Go to the directory vtk_python39_wheel/, where the wheel lies (\*.whl).
Use this wheel to install, e.g:
* pip install vtk-9.0.20210105-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl
* Then install mayavi (pip install mayavi or also build it from source, as there could be incapabilities with vtk9).

pip
---
For **python3.9** follow the instructions above, then continue with (else do the following):
* pip install supersolids

Archlinux
---------
It is provided in the AUR under https://aur.archlinux.org/python-supersolids.git
* For **python3.9** follow the instructions above,
then remove mayavi from the dependencies and run "makepkg -sic".
* For **python3.8** remove the dependecies in the PKGBUILD and uncomment
the pip install lines instead.

Windows
-------
You need to add python to your path (if you didn't do it, when installing python/anaconda).
* Then continue with pip installation

Source
---------------------------
Go to the directory, where the "setup.py" lies.
* For **Linux** use "python setup.py install --user" from console to **build** and **install** the package

Usage
-----
The package uses __main__.py, so it can be run as module.
To get help for the flags, run:
* python -m supersolids -h
* python -m supersolids.tools.load_npz -h
* python -m supersolids.tools.simulate_npz -h

To actually run (example):
* python -m supersolids -Res='{"x": 16, "y": 32, "z": 62}' -Box='{"x0": -10, "x1": 10, "y0": -6, "y1": 5, "z0": -8, "z1": 8}'
* python -m supersolids.tools.load_npz -frame_start=79000
* python -m supersolids.tools.simulate_npz -dir_name=movie004 -filename_npz=step_079000.npz

If you use an IDE and your script parameter includes double quotes,
escape the double quotes with backslashes, for example:
"-Res={\\"x\\": 256}" "-Box={\\"x0\\": -10, \\"x1\\": 10}" "-a={\\"a_x\\": 2.0}" -max_timesteps=51
"-V=lambda x, y, z: 100.0 * np.exp(-(x ** 2 + y ** 2)/ 1.0 ** 2)"

The default path for the results is ~/supersolids/results
