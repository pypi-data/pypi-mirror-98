Description: # Flight
        The python component used by [Lorikeet](https:/github.com/rhysnewell/Lorikeet) and [Rosella](https:/github.com/rhysnewell/rosella)
        It can be used as a standalone binning algorithm for MAGs, but will not include contig SNP information
        which is collected by Rosella.
        # Installation
