Description: LIR Python Likelihood Ratio Library
        ===================================
        
        This library provides a collection of scripts to aid calibration, and
        calculation and evaluation of Likelihood Ratios.
        
        ## A simple score-based LR system
        
        A score-based LR system needs a scorer and a calibrator. The most basic setup
        uses a training set and a test set. Both the scorer and the calibrator are
        fitted on the training set.
        
        ```python
        import lir
        import numpy as np
        from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
        
        # generate some data randomly from a normal distribution
        X = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(loc=0, size=(100, 1)),
                      np.random.normal(loc=1, size=(100, 1))])
        y = np.concatenate([np.zeros(100), np.ones(100)])
        
        # split the data into train and test
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
        
        # initialize a scorer and a calibrator
        scorer = LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs')  # choose any sklearn style classifier
        calibrator = lir.KDECalibrator()  # use plain KDE for calibration
        calibrated_scorer = lir.CalibratedScorer(scorer, calibrator)
        
        # fit and predict
        calibrated_scorer.fit(X_train, y_train)
        lrs_test = calibrated_scorer.predict_lr(X_test)
        
        # print the quality of the system as log likelihood ratio cost (lower is better)
        print('The log likelihood ratio cost is', lir.cllr(lrs_test, y_test), '(lower is better)')
        print('The discriminative power is', lir.cllr_min(lrs_test, y_test), '(lower is better)')
        
        # plot calibration
        import lir.plotting
        lir.plotting.plot_pav(lrs_test, y_test)
        ```
        
        The log likelihood ratio cost (CLLR) may be used as a metric of performance.
        In this case it should yield a value of around .8, but highly variable due to
        the small number of samples. Increase the sample size to get more stable
        results.
