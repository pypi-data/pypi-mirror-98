# Pipedown :shushing_face:

Pipedown is a machine learning model pipelining package for Python.  It doesn't
really *do* much, it just lets you define a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of
modeling steps, each of which is defined as a class with `fit` and `run`
methods (like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)), and it runs your nodes
in order and provides a visualization of the DAG.

Pipedown is designed around:

* A **single code path**: use the same code for training, validation, and inference on new test data.
* **Modularity** and **testability**: each node is defined as its own class with `fit()` and `run()` methods, making it easy to unit test each node.
* **Visibility**: pipedown comes with an html viewer to explore the structure of your DAGs, and shows links to the source code associated with each node.
* **Portability**: pipedown models can easily be trained in one environment (e.g. a batch job), serialized, and then loaded into another environment (e.g. a model server) for inference.
* **State**: DAG nodes can store state; they aren't just stateless functions.
* **Flexibility**: pipedown allows you to define models as DAGs instead of just linear pipelines (like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)), but doesn't force your project to have a specific file structure (like [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro)).

Pipedown is NOT an ETL / data engineering / task scheduler tool - for that use
something like Airflow, Argo, Dask, Prefect, etc.  You can do some basic and
inefficient data processing with Pipedown, but really it's focused on creating
portable model pipelines.

Still in the super early stages - don't use this yet!

## Requirements

To use the visualization tools, you need to have
[graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) installed.  On Ubuntu, you can install with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

## Installation

Just use pip!

```bash
pip install pipedown
```

## Getting Started

Todo...

## Thanks

Syntax higlighting in the DAG viewer is done using [higlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
with the great Atom One Dark ReasonML theme by Gidi Morris / Daniel Gamage.
