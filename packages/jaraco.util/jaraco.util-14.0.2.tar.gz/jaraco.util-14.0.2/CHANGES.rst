9.0.1
=====

* Apply fix in 8.9.1 to 9.0.

9.0
===

* ``itertools.one()`` now always raises a ValueError and never a
  StopIteration.

8.9.1
=====

* Use six for callable in NonDataProperty, restoring Python 3.1 compatibility.

8.9
===

* Added ``KeyTransformingDict.matching_key_for``, allowing the original key
  to be returned.

8.8
===

8.7
===

* Removed dependency links for ``six``.

8.6
===

* Added ``collections`` module with an Everything collection.

===

  compatibility). Expect `jaraco.dateutil` to be removed in 9.0.

8.0
===

* Package no longer uses 2to3 for Python 3 support, but instead relies on a
  unified code base and compatibility routines (including six).
* Moved ``wallpaper`` module to ``jaraco.desktop`` project.

7.2
===

* ``dictlib.FrozenDict`` now supplies ``.copy``.
* Fixed issue in ``FrozenDict`` where ``.__eq__`` didn't work on other
  FrozenDict instances.

7.1
===

7.0
===

* Moved `blowfish` module to jaraco.crypto.

===

  function, causing that function to only be called once per interval, despite
  the number of calls attempted.
* Added `itertools.suppress_exceptions`. Use it to iterate over callables,
  suppressing exceptions.

6.1
===

* Added `context` module, with a null_context context manager. It is suitable
  for taking the place of a real context when no context is needed.

6.0
===

  is None. This approach appears to work better for the majority of use-cases.

5.4
===

===

* Added `string.global_format` and `string.namespace_format` for formatting
  a string with globals and with both globals and locals.

4.1
===

* Added jaraco.util.dictlib.IdentityOverrideMap
* Added jaraco.util.itertools.always_iterable
* All modules now use unicode literals, consistent with Python 3 syntax
