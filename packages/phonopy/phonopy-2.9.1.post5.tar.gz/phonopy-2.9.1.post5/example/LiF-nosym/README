This is an example of using --nosym option in LiF. The displacements are created by

% phonopy -d --dim="2 2 2" --nosym

48 POSCARs are created. FORCE_SETS is created from the forces on atoms of these structures. Then DOS is calcualted by

% phonopy -p --dim="2 2 2" --mp="20 20 20" --nosym

where --nosym is probably required though it may work without --nosym.

If non-analytical term correction is used, BORN file has to be created without considering symmetry. In the case of this example, 8 Born effective charge tensors (lines) have to be written in BORN file.

% phonopy -p --dim="2 2 2" --mp="20 20 20" --nosym --nac
