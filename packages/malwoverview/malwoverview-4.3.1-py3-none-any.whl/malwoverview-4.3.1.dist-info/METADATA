# Current Version: 4.3.1

     Important note:  Malwoverview does NOT submit samples to Virus Total or Hybrid Analysis by 
     default. It submits only hashes, so respecting Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). Nonetheless, 
     if you use the "-V" (uppercase), "-A" (uppercase) or "-P" (uppercase), so Malwoverview SUBMITS your 
     malware sample to Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm, respectively. Additionally, options 
     "-Y" and "-T" also sent the Android package from Android device to Hybrid-Analysis and Virus 
     Total, respectively.  


# ABOUT

Malwoverview.py is a first response tool for threat hunting, which performs an initial and quick 
triage of malware samples, URLs, IP addresses, domains, malware families, IOCs and hashes.

This tool aims to : 

1. Determine similar executable malware samples (PE/PE+) according to the import table (imphash) and group 
   them by different colors (pay attention to the second column from output). Thus, colors matter!
2. Show hash information on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus, Alien Vault, 
   Malpedia and ThreatCrowd engines. 
3. Determining whether the malware samples contain overlay and, if you want, extract it. 
4. Check suspect files on Virus Total, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.
5. Check URLs on Virus Total, Malshare, Polyswarm, URLhaus engines and Alien Vault. 
6. Download malware samples from Hybrid Analysis, Malshare, URLHaus, Polyswarm and Malpedia engines.
7. Submit malware samples to VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis and Polyswarm.
8. List last suspected URLs from URLHaus.
9. List last payloads from URLHaus. 
10. Search for specific payloads on the Malshare.
11. Search for similar payloads (PE32/PE32+) on Polyswarm engine.
12. Classify all files in a directory searching information on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. 
13. Make reports about a suspect domain using different engines such as VirusTotal, Malpedia and 
    ThreatCrowd. 
14. Check APK packages directly from Android devices against Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. 
15. Submit APK packages directly from Android devices to Hybrid Analysis and Virus Total. 
16. Show URLs related to an user provided tag from URLHaus.
17. Show payloads related to a tag (signature) from URLHaus.
18. Show information about an IP address from Virus Total, Alien Vault, Malpedia and ThreatCrowd.
19. Show IP address, domain and URL information from Polyswarm. 
21. Perform meta-search on Polyswarm Network using several criteria: imphash, IPv4, domain, URL and
    malware family. 
22. Gather threat hunting information from AlienVault using different criteria. 
23. Gather threat hunting information from Malpedia using different criteria. 
24. Gather threat hunting information from ThreatCrowd using different criteria. 
25. Provide Yara rules and associated information from Valhalla. 
26. Gather threat hunting information from Malware Bazaar using different criteria. 
27. Gather IOC information from ThreatFox using different criteria.

# INSTALLATION 

This tool has been tested on Ubuntu, Kali Linux 2021, REMnux, Windows 8.1 and 10. Malwoverview 
can be installed by executing the following command:

      pip3.9 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) 
      or...
      python -m pip install -U malwoverview
      or...
      git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview


To use Malwoverview you should insert VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, URLHaus, Malshare, Polyswarm,
Alien Vault and Malpedia APIs into the .malwapi.conf configuration file (the default one at the 
home directory -- if the file doesn't exist, so you should create it) or you could create a 
custom configuration file and indicate it by using the -c option. 

A special note about the Alien Vault: it is necessary to subscribe to pulses on Alien Vault 
website before using -n 1 option.  

The .malwapi.conf configuration file (from the the home directory) has the following format:

      [VIRUSTOTAL]
      VTAPI = 

      [HYBRID-ANALYSIS]
      HAAPI = 

      [MALSHARE]
      MALSHAREAPI = 

      [HAUSSUBMIT]
      HAUSSUBMITAPI =

      [POLYSWARM]
      POLYAPI = 

      [ALIENVAULT]
      ALIENAPI = 

      [MALPEDIA]
      MALPEDIAAPI =

      [VALHALLA]
      VALHALLAAPI =


The APIs can be requested on the respective service websites:

1. Virus Total (community and paid API): https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us
2. Hybrid Analysis: https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/signup
3. Malshare: https://malshare.com/doc.php
4. URLHaus: https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/api/#account 
5. Polyswarm: https://docs.polyswarm.io/consumers
6. Alien Vault: https://otx.alienvault.com/api
7. Malpedia: It doesn't offer open registration, but you can request an user account 
directly through Twitter (DM) or feedback e-email. The Malpedia Twitter handle is @malpedia.
8. Valhalla: You can use a demo API key or contract the Valhalla service for a private key.
Valhalla demo-API key is: 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111.
9. ThreatCrowd: It isn't necessary an API.
10. Malware Bazaar: It isn't necessary an API.
11. ThreatFox: It isn't necessary an API.

----------------------------------------------------
A special note about API requests to the MALPEDIA:
----------------------------------------------------

The service and acceptance is based on the community vetting. Thus, it's recommended 
you send a request for an API from your business e-mail address and NOT 
public/free one (Gmail, Outlook and so on). Additionally, it'd be great whether 
you provided further information about you (LinkedIn account, Twitter and so on) 
because it would make simpler to proof your identity, professional profile and 
legitimacy, so making quicker the approval of your request.  

-----------------------------------------------------


In Windows systems, create the .malwapi.conf file in the C:\Users\\[username\] directory 
(Windows home user directory). In Linux systems, create the .malwapi.conf file in 
/home/\[username\] directory (Linux home user directory).

Additionally, you don't need to specify "-w 1" option while using malwoverview.py on Windows
anymore. 

To check the installation, execute:

       malwoverview.py --help

Further information is available on: 

       (PYPI.org repository) https://pypi.org/project/malwoverview/
       (Github) https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview

If you want to perform the manual steps (usually, it is not necessary), so few steps will be necessary:

## Kali Linux (manual steps)

1. Python version 3.8 or later (Only Python 3.x !!! It does NOT work using Python 2.7) 

       $ apt-get install python3.9  (for example)

2. Python-magic.  

      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:

       $ pip3.9 install python-magic

      Or compiling it from the github repository:

       $ git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
       $ cd python-magic/
       $ python3.9 setup.py build
       $ python3.9 setup.py install

      As there are serious problems about existing two versions of python-magic package, my 
      recommendation is to install it from github (second procedure above) and copy the magic.py 
      file to the SAME directory of malwoverview tool. 

3. Install several Python packages: 

       $ pip3.9 install -r requirements.txt

       OR

       $ pip3.9 install -U pefile
       $ pip3.9 install -U colorama
       $ pip3.9 install -U simplejson
       $ pip3.9 install -U python-magic
       $ pip3.9 install -U requests
       $ pip3.9 install -U validators
       $ pip3.9 install -U geocoder
       $ pip3.9 install -U polyswarm-api
       $ pip3.9 install -U pathlib
       $ pip3.9 install -U configparser
       $ pip3.9 install -U valhallaAPI

4. To check an Android mobile you need to install the "adb" program by executing the following command:

       # apt get install adb

   PS: before trying Android's options, check:

       * If the adb program is listed in the PATH environment variable.
       * If the system has authorized access to the device by using "adb devices -l"

5. Finally, you can install Malwoverview using one of the following methods:

         pip3.9 install git+https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview (preferred method) 

         or...

         python -m pip install -U malwoverview

         or...

         git clone https://github.com/alexandreborges/malwoverview


## Windows (manual steps)

1. Install the Python version 3.8.x or later from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ 

2. Python-magic. 

      To install python-magic package you can execute the following command:

       C:\> python.exe -m pip install python-magic

      Or compiling it from the github repository:

       C:\> git clone https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
       C:\> cd python-magic/
       C:\> python.exe setup.py build
       C:\> python.exe setup.py install

3. Install several Python packages: 

       C:\> python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt

       OR: 

       C:\> python.exe -m pip install -U pefile
       C:\> python.exe -m pip install -U colorama

      -v VIRUSTOTAL, --virustotal VIRUSTOTAL
                        If using "-v 1", so it queries the Virus Total database for positives and 
                        totals. If "v 2" (which can be used only together with -f option), so it 
                        shows antivirus reports from the main players. If "v 3", so the binary's IAT 
                        and EAT are also shown. Remember: you need to edit the .malwapi.conf and insert 
                        your VT API.
      -a HYBRID_ANALYSIS, --hybrid HYBRID_ANALYSIS
                        Queries the Hybrid Analysis database for getting a general report. Possible

      -H FILE_HASH, --hash FILE_HASH
                        This option specifies the hash to be checked on Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis. 
                        For the Hybrid Analysis report you must use it with the -e option.
      -V FILENAME_VT, --vtsubmit FILENAME_VT
                        Submits a file(up to 32MB) for Virus Total scanning and gets the report. Attention: 
                        use forward slash to specify the target file even on Windows systems. Furthermore, 
                        the minimum waiting time is set up in 90 seconds because the Virus Total waiting 
                        queue. If an error occurs, so wait few minutes and try to access the report by 
                        using -f option.
      -A SUBMIT_HA, --submitha SUBMIT_HA
                        Submits a file(up to 32MB) to be scanned by the Hybrid Analysis engine. Use the 
                        -e option to specify the best environment to run the suspicious file.
      -g HA_STATUS, --hastatus HA_STATUS
                        Checks the report's status of submitted samples to Hybrid Analysis engine by 
                        providing the job ID. Possible returned status values are: IN_QUEUE, SUCCESS,
                        ERROR, IN_PROGRESS and PARTIAL_SUCCESS.
      -D DOWNLOAD, --download DOWNLOAD
                        Downloads the sample from Hybrid Analysis, Malshare and Polyswarm. Options 
                        -H or -L (Hybrid Analysis and Malshare, respectively) must be specified as well 
                        -O option for Polyswarm engine.
      -e HA_ENVIRONMENT, --haenv HA_ENVIRONMENT
                        This option specifies the used environment to be used to test the samlple on 
                        Hybrid Analysis: <0> Windows 7 32-bits; <1> Windows 7 32-bits (with HWP Support); 
                        <2> Windows 7 64-bits; <3> Android; <4> Linux 64-bits environment. This option 
                        is used together either -H option or the -A option.
      -t MULTITHREAD, --thread MULTITHREAD
                        (optional) This option has several different meanings according to chosen the 
                        value. Possible values: <1>: This value is used to force multithreads on Linux 
                        whether: the -d option is specified AND you have a PAID Virus Total API or you
                        are NOT checking the VT while using the -d option. PS1: using this option causes 
                        Imphashes not to be grouped anymore; PS2: it also works on Windows, but there is 
                        not gain in performance; <2>: This value should be used with -d option in
                        two scenarios: 1) either including the "-v 1" option (Virus Total -- you'll see 
                        a complete VT response whether you have the private API) for a multithread searching
                        and reduced output; 2) or including the -a option (Hybrid Analysis) for a multithread 
                        searching to get a complete and amazing output. If you are using the -a option, so 
                        you should pickup the right number represening the testing environment to adjust the 
                        output to your sample types. PS1: certainly, if you have a directory holding 
                        many malware samples, so you will want to test this option with -a option; PS2: it 
                        also works on Windows, but there is not gain in performance; <3>: You should use 
                        this value with -v option if you have a public Virus Total API. It forces a one 
                        minute wait every 4 malware samples, but allows obtaining a complete evaluation of 
                        the malware repository.
      -l MALSHARE_HASHES, --malsharelist MALSHARE_HASHES
                        This option shows hashes of a specific type from the last 24 hours from Malshare 
                        repository. Possible values are: 1: PE32 (default) ; 2: Dalvik ; 3: ELF ; 4: HTML ;
                        5: ASCII ; 6: PHP ; 7: Java ; 8: RAR ; 9: Zip ; 10: UTF-8 ; 11: MS-DOS ; 12: data ; 
                        13: PDF ; 14: Composite(OLE). You need to insert your Malshare API into the 
                        .malwapi.conf file.
      -L MALSHARE_HASH_SEARCH, --malsharehash MALSHARE_HASH_SEARCH
                        Searches for the provided hash on the Malshare repository. You need to insert your 
                        Malshare API into the .malwapi.conf file. PS: sometimes the Malshare website is 
                        unavailable, so should check the website availability if you get some error message.
      -K HAUS_PAYLOAD_URL, --haus_payloadbatch HAUS_PAYLOAD_URL
                        THis option has few possible values: <1> Retrieves a list of downloadable links of 
                        recent PAYLOADS (last 3 days, limited to 1000 entries) from URLHaus website; <2>: 
                        Retrieves a list of recent URLs (last 3 days, limited to 1000 entries) from URLHaus
                        website. Take care: each link take you to download a passworless zip file containing 
                        a malware, so your AV can generate alerts!
      -U URL_HAUS_QUERY, --haus_query URL_HAUS_QUERY
                        Queries a URL on the URLHaus website.
      -j HAUS_HASH, --haus_hash HAUS_HASH
                        Queries information about a provided payload's hash (md5 or sha256) on the URLHaus 
                        website.
      -S URL_HAUS_SUB, --haus_submission URL_HAUS_SUB
                        Submits a URL used to distribute malware (executable, script, document) to the

      -B BAZAAR_ARG, --bazaararg BAZAAR_ARG
                        Provides argument to -b Bazaar and ThreatFox option. If you specified "-b 1" 
                        then the -B's argument must be a hash; If you specified "-b 2" then -B's argument 
                        must be a malware tag; If you specified "-b 3" then the argument must be a imphash;
                        If you specified "-b 4", so the argument must be "100 or time", where "100" lists 
                        last "100 samples" and "time" lists last samples added to Malware Bazaar in the last
                        60 minutes; If you specified "-b 5" then the -B's argument must be a SHA256 hash; If you 
                        specified "-b 6", so the -B's value is the number of DAYS to filter IOCs. The default 
                        (and max) is 90 (days); If you used "-b 7" so the -B's argument is the IOC you want
                        to search for; If you used "-b 8", so the -B's argument is the TAG you want search 
                        for; If you used "-b 9", so the -B argument is the malware family you want to search
                        for;


      Remember that public VT API only allows 4 searches per second (as shown at the image above). Therefore,
      if you are willing to wait some minutes, so you can use the -p option, which forces a one minute wait 
      every 4 malware samples, but allows obtaining a complete evaluation of the repository.


      * ATTENTION 1: if the directory contains many malware samples while using -d option, so malwoverview.py
                     could take some time. Nonetheless, you can use the new -t option (multithreading) to
                     speed-up things. :)

      ** ATTENTION 2: All engines enforces quota of submission and/or verification per day and/or month. 
                      Take care!

      *** ATTENTION 3: Some options searching on Hybrid Analysis strongly depend of the "-e" option, which 
                       specifies the environment. Therefore, to check an Android sample (for example) it is 
                       necessary to use the right environment (-e 3 for Android).
