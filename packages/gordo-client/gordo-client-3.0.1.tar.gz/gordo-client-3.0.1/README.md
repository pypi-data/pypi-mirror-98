### Development Tools.

#### Setup.
We use [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) and 
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to speed up the development.

You need to install them only once.

The simplest way to get both is to install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
first, with the officially recommended way:
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```
You may need to run following command then:
```
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.poetry/bin"' >> $HOME/.zshrc
```

(Check out alternative instructions for `poetry` installation 
[here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))

After that [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is able to automatically
provide you with `invoke` installed in the project virtual env.  So you can
do one of following [task](#Automated-Tasks):
```
# Run it directly
poetry run inv [task]

# Run it from the virtual environment
poetry shell
inv [task]

# Have an alias (use custom name to avoid clashing with `inv` and `invoke`)
alias invv='poetry run inv'
invv [task]
```

An alternative way to install all tools is using 
[pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/):

```
python3.7 -m pip install pipx --user
pipx install poetry
pipx install invoke
```
##### Setup Virtual Environment.
Run `poetry install` to install or re-install all dependencies.

Run `poetry update` to update the locked dependencies to the most recent
version, honoring the constrains put inside `pyproject.toml`.


#### Automated Tasks.
[invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) is used to run some common tasks.
Run one of these from the root of the project.

```
inv fmt       # Apply automatic code formatting.
inv check     # Run static checks.
inv test      # Run tests.
```

The tasks may be chained as following: `inv fmt check test`.

The tasks are defined in [tasks.py](./tasks.py) file.
Run `inv -l` to see a list of all available tasks.
