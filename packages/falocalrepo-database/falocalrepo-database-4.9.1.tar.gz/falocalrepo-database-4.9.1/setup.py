Can be empty if the file contained errors and could not be recognised upon download\n* `FILESAVED` 1 if the file was successfully downloaded and saved, 0 if there was an error during download\n* `FAVORITE` a bar-separated list of users that have "faved" the submission\n* `MENTIONS` a bar-separated list of users that are mentioned in the submission description as links\n* `FOLDER` the folder of the submission (`gallery` or `scraps`)\n* `USERUPDATE` whether the submission was added as a user update or favorite/single entry\n\n### Journals\n\nThe journals table contains the metadata of the journals downloaded by the program.\n\n* `ID` the id of the journal\n* `AUTHOR` the username of the author (uploader) in full format\n* `TITLE`\n* `DATE` upload date in the format YYYY-MM-DD\n* `CONTENT` content in html format\n* `MENTIONS` a bar-separated list of users that are mentioned in the journal content as links\n* `USERUPDATE` whether the journal was added as a user update or favorite/single entry\n\n## Submission Files\n\nThe `save_submission` functions saves the submission metadata in the database and stores the files.\n\nSubmission files are saved in a tiered tree structure based on their submission ID. ID\'s are zero-padded to 10 digits and then broken up in 5 segments of 2 digits; each of this segments represents a folder tha will be created in the tree.\n\nFor example, a submission `1457893` will be padded to `0001457893` and divided into `00`, `01`, `45`, `78`, `93`. The submission file will then be saved as `00/01/45/78/93/submission.file` with the correct extension extracted from the file itself - FurAffinity links do not always contain the right extension and often confuse jpg and png.\n\n## Upgrading Database\n\nThe `FADatabase.upgrade` function allows to upgrade the database to the current version.\n\n_Note:_ Versions before 2.7.0 are not supported by falocalrepo-database version 3.0.0 and above. To update from those to the new version use [falocalrepo](https://gitlab.com/MatteoCampinoti94/FALocalRepo/-/releases/v2.11.2) version 2.11.2 to update the database to version 2.7.0\n',
