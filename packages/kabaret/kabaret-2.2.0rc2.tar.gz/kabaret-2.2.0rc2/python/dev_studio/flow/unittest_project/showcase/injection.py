        <H1>Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control</H1>
        <H2>Why ?</H2>
        <p>
        Hi-level Objects often need to relate each others.
        </p>
        <p>
        When building a self contained flow, this is not an issue.
        But while building flow libraries, you face a situation where
        you have to deliver Objects for every related high level 
        concepts so that they can interact thru their relations.
        </p>
        <p>
        The situation is also bad for the library users who will need
        to adopt all the concepts of the library because they can't
        change the relation between them.
        </p>
        <p>
        As an example, let's consider you want to build a Task 
        system:<br>
        You use a `Map` to manage a list of `Task`.<br>
        A `Task` has `start_date` and `duration`, as well as a 
        `assigned_user` which is a `Connection` to a `User`.<br>
        At this point you need to define what is a `User` and the 
        interface it needs to interact with your `Task`. So you had 
        a `Team` map containing `User` items...<br>
        You Task system now contains Tasks and Users and in order to
        use it in a pipeline flow one needs to adopt your Task system
        as well as your User system. <b>This sucks !!!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        On this example, an <b>Inversion of Control</b> is to give
        the pipeline flow the control over the relation used by the Task
        lib flow.<br>
        A common way to achieve this is to <b>inject</b> the 
        <b>dependencies</b> inside the Task flow lib from the pipeline flow
        instead of letting the Task flow lib define them.
        </p>
        <H3>Why is it a problem ?</H3>
        <p>
        A flow Object dependencies are defined by the `Child` and `Map`
        contained in all its children. (`Param` are `Child`, but `Parent` 
        and `Relative` are special and dont apply here).<br>
        More precisely, they are defined by the type of Objects
        each `Relation` relate to and the type of item mapped to each `Map`.<br>
        The classic way to change those (in order to change the dependencies) is
        by inheritance: you inherit the relation owner and override the relation 
        by defining a new one with the same name.<br>
        The probleme is that you now need to use this new class instead of the one 
        containing the Relation you altered. So you also need to inherit its
        parent's class. And this goes up to your Project class !<br>
        <b>This sucks !!!</b><br>
        But keep your pants on and read on, we have a
        solution for this situation: <b>Dependency Injection</b>
        </p>
        <p>
        Also, it's worth specifying that dependency injection also makes writing 
        test code extremely easier as it lets you replace/mock-up part of the
        system to isolate the component you want to test.
        </p>
        <H2>How ?</H2>
        <p>
        So we want to "override" the <b>related type</b> of some Relations, and
        the <b>mapped type</b> of some Maps.<br>
        We want to do it with different types on different flow, be them pipeline
        flows or lib flows.<br>
        And as alwawy, we want to do from within the flow itsef so that everything
        is well tight together.<br>
        Also, as a lib flow developer, we want to specify which types can be 
        <b>injected</b> ("overidden") in my lib Objects.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first step is specifying that a Relation supports injection. This is 
        done by calling `injectable()` on it.<br>
        In this example, the `my_studio.flow.lib.foo` lib flow defines a `Foo` 
        Object that contains a `FooChild` Object. Let's say you want your lib users
        to be able to inject their Object intead of using your 'FooChild':
        <pre>
            # my_studio/flow/lib/foo.py`

            class Foo(flow.Object):    
                my_child = flow.Child(FooChild).injectable()

        </pre>
        The second step is to use the foo lib and inject a new type instead of
        `FooChild`.<br>
        This is done by defining an `_injection_provider()` method in any parent
        of the `Foo` Object.<br>
        In this example, we inject a `FooChild` subclass that extends it with
        the `is_awesome` Param.
        <pre>
            from my_studio.flow.lib.foo import Foo, FooChild

            class MySuperFooChild(FooChild):
                is_super = flow.BoolParam(True)

            class Project(flow.Object, flow.InjectionProvider):

                foo = flow.Child(Foo)

                def _injection_provider(self, slot_name, default_type):
                    if default_type is FooChild:
                        return MySuperFooChild
        </pre>
        With this set up, your `Project` pipeline flow is using the `foo` lib
        flow with an extended FooChild.
        <b>This rocks !!!</b>
        </p>

        <H2>Demo</H2>
        <p>
        In the "Demo" group above here you can see a couple of Tasks and a 
        Team of Users.<br>
        Each Task can be assigned a User by drag'n'drop.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        The Task type is defined in a library. It uses a default User type 
        with a 'dept' param with 'Preprod', 'Prod' and 'Edit' multiple choices.
        </p>
        <p>
        We want to use this library but we have more departments for our users,
        and we also have squad and chapters.<br>
        We define a new User class by inheriting the lib's one and extending it
        with more params. This User type in then injected into the lib.<br>
        We also Inject a custom DeptChoiceValue into the lib to have our own
        department choices.
        </p>
        <H2>Notes</H2>
        <p>
        This demo can't showcase it but injections are tied to the current
        flow root so that they can be different per project. This means you
        can use the same flow lib injected differently in several pipelines.<br>
        On the other hand, the injections are resolved only once per pipeline
        and your providers will never be called twice on the same `slot_name`. 
        This means that all instances of a Project will use the same 
        injections. This is a feature and not a restriction: a [work/data]flow 
        must be consistent in all its occurences in order to provide all the
        intended benefits.
