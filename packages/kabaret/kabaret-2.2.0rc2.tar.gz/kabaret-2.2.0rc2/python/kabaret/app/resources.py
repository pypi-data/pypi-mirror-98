'''
Generic file resouces repository.

This package provide a way to register some folders under a given name
(:meth:`add_folder`) and later retreive files by their basename and
registered folder name (:meth:`get`).

When registering a folder with the same name as another one, the lookup will
favorize the last one and fall back to the first one.

This way you can extend and/or override the resources available under a given
folder name.

You can deal with any kind of files, but in the case of images there are a couple
helper functions: :meth:`get_pixmap()` and :meth:`get_icon()`

Every search result is cached so disk access is minimized. You don't need to
cache your resources next to their usage code, just can keep calling
``resources.get()`` as much as you want.

You can inspect the available resources with :meth:`get_folder_names()`,
:meth:`list_folder()` and :meth:`list_folder_paths()`

.. note::

    Files starting with an underscore ``_`` are ignored.

def add_folder(name, path):
    '''
    Register a folder to the search path.

    The ``name`` will be used to access files.

    You can use :meth:`get_folder_names` to get a list of all declared names.

    The ``path`` can be a file inside the folder
    to register, or the path of the folder itself.

    If a folder with the same name was previously added, the
    files from the last one overrides the previous one but
    the previous files not available in the last one are
    still accessible.

    In other words: the last call overrides and extends the previous ones.

    Typical resource declaration:

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: my_studio/icons/emoji/__init__.py

        # We're in a package folder containing some png files
        # Every file will be accessible, and overrides previous
        # declarations of 'icons.emoji' files
        import kabaret.app.resources
        kabaret.app.resources.add_folder('icons.emoji', __file__)

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: my_studio/gui.py

        # Be sure to have the resource modules imported at least once
        # This is typically done in the module defining your session
        from my_studio.icons import emoji

    Typical resource access:

    .. code-block:: python
        :caption: my_studio/flows/my_dope_flow/__init__.py

        # Use anywhere
        from kabaret.app import resources
