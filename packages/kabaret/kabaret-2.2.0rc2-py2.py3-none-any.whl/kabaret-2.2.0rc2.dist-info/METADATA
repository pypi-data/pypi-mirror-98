# Changelog

## [2.2.0] - 2020-10-29

### ! Breaking changes !

The return value of the `session.cmds.Flow.ls()` command has changed to also include the related oid. This is needed by the
introduction of the new `Relative` relation with which you can no longer assume that a related object's id is
`<relation_owner_id>/<related_name>`. 

If you were using `ls` in automation scripts, you will need to update its returned value unpacking.

Previou return value:
`(relation_name, relation_type, is_action, is_map, ui_config), mapped_names`

New return value:
`(related_oid, relation_name, relation_type, is_action, is_map, ui_config), mapped_names`

### Added

issue #79 - New Flow command `session.cmds.Flow.set_home_oid(my_oid)` to configure the "Home" action.

issue #83 - New ui option `navigation_bar`. If set to `False`, the flow page will hide the navigation bar.
See example usages in showcase `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.ui_config`. 
Also added an entry in the FlowView "Options" menu to toggle the navigation bar visible/hidden.

issue #78 - View titles can be formated by using a `view_id` like `<formater>|<view_id>` where formater
is used like `formater.format(some_title)`. This particularly interesting to control the title of views 
created by using `goto_target` in the return value of a `flow.Action.run()`.

issue #71 - Action menus for Relation and Map items can contain sub-menus based on the Action group. 
Use `relation.ui(action_submenus=True)` and/or `relation.ui(items_action_submenus=True)`.

issue #60 - Any session created is accessible with `kabaret.app.get_session(my_session_uid)`. You can
get the last created one with `kabaret.app.get_session()`.

issue #73 - `choice` editor support arbitrary icon for each choice using the `choice_icons` option.

issue #11 - `textarea` editor now correctly shows when edited and is correctly auto-applied in action dialogs.
A 'Cancel' button was added to revert to the last loaded value. The 'Apply' and 'Cancel' buttons are now hidden
until an edit is made. A new option `buttons_side` was added to specify the buttons side.

issue #31 - Added the ability to access other projects in the flow with `self.root().project('OtherProjectName')`

issue #74 - Added `injectable()` method on `Child` relations (and sub relations) which let developer inject their Object types inside someone else flow using the `kabaret.flow.injection` module. See the documentation at https://kabaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/injection.html for details.

issue #70 - Customizable double click behaviour on `Map` items. See usage and example in `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.maps.map_actions`, and here: https://gitlab.com/kabaretstudio/kabaret/-/issues/70#note_409303471

issue #66 - Added a new relation `Relative` which gives access to any Object in the flow given an `oid` relative to its parent. See usage and code example in `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.showcase.relations`.

issue #68 - Added `kabaret.flow.Connection.allow_cross_project()` to allow Connection / Ref to
an object inside another project.

merge !101 - New GUI Style in `kabaret.app.ui.gui.styles.gray.GrayStyle()`

### Changed

merge !128 - The LabelEditor text is now selectable.
issue #72 - The target view of a `flow.Action.run()` is automatically made visible / active tab.

issue #70 - You can no longer create a Mapped Item with a name used in
the Map class or its ancestor classes.

issue #56 - Use scrollbar rather than submenu when having many items in NavigationBar context menus

merge !106 - Change ChoiceValueEditor from QToolButton to QComboBox

### Fixed

issue #93 - Injections produce too many messages (info messages are now debug only message)

issue #95 - Kabaret didn't work with python 3.9

issue #30 - Removed the `redis<3.0.0` restriction in `install_requires`.

issue #72 - Fixed a bug when the return value of a `flow.Action.run()` has a `goto_target_type` and no `goto_target`.

issue #63 - In FlowView: Action buttons, Mapped items and Reference fields where inside the last Relation instead of at view toplevel.

issue #77 - 10 times faster FlowView page loading.

issue #67 - `KabaretSession.session_uid()` may return a unique id that is rejected by Redis. 

issue #45 - "Internal C++ object already deleted" error when navigating to a page before current page
loading is finished.

issue #53 - Bug in corner case scenarii when listing Object Actions.

issue #52 - When a Ref source was updated, it would not be updated for user who already loaded it.

issue #57 - Connections relations were always displayed first in GUI.

issue #12 - Dynamic UI Properties

Any property set on a `Relation.ui()` can now be overridden per Object instance by overridding `Object._fill_ui(ui)`
This has been a long request, especially to have dynamic value for the `icon` and `hidden` properties.

issue #48 - Custom UI Page

It is now possible to provide an arbitrary widget to display/edit an Object in the Flow view.

This can be specified at the relation's level with `Relation(...).ui(custom_page='my_module.MyWidget')`.
Or at the Object level by overridding `Object._fill_ui(ui)`.

See `dev_studio.flow.unittest_project.UnittestProject` "Custom Page" for details and example.

### Fixed

issue #12 - When expanding a Connection relation in GUI, sub fields don't update.
issue #12 - (correlated) When showing not-child item in DynamicMap (a.k.a Map as View), items don't update.

issue #47 - Fix Map item styling consistency

The `style` dict in `Map._fill_row_style` now accepts 'foreground_color' as well as 'foreground-color' etc... And
the value may be in the form (255,255,255) as well as '#FFFFFF'
