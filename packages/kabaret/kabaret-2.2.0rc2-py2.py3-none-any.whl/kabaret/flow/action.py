    kabaret.flow.action

    Defines the Action class, an object on which UI commands can call
    the run() method to execute some code.

    The return value of run() dictates some UI behavior
    (see Action.run() doc).

    Defines the DropAction class, an object used to handle GUI drops
    on the ConnectAction parent.
    (NB: it is not a subclasse of Action and wont show up as a button)

        The value returned by run(button) will be inspected by callers to
        decide how they should react.
        This helper class method will generate a result matching its args:
            close: (bool)
                Prevent the action dialog to be closed when set to False
            refresh: (bool)
                Force a reload of the parent page avec dialog close
                (This should not be needed anymore thanks to touch() calls...)
            goto: (oid)
                Force the caller to load the given oid page.
            goto_target: (string or "_NEW_")
                The string identifer of the view targeted by the goto directive.
                The default targeted view is the current one or the one that created
                the action dialog. Spcecifying a target can be usefull to alter
                another view. If the specified target is not found, a new view
                will be created with this identifier so that further use of the
                action will affect this new view.
                The special identifier "_NEW_" can be used to force the creation
                of a new view.
            goto_target_type: (string)
                The type of the view targeted by the goto directive.
                Default is 'Flow'
                An easy way to find out the available type names is to use
                a obviously invalid value like "???" and look for the error
                message: it will contain a list of available type names.
            next_action: (oid)
                Force the dialog to not close but load the ui for the action
                with the given oid.
                This is the way to implement "Wizard Pages"
