    This is a major version release of python-cinderclient. Backwards
    compatibility has been removed for some long standing deprecations and
    support for the Cinder v1 API has been removed. Prior to upgrading to this
    release, ensure all Cinder services that need to be managed are 13.0.0
    (Rocky) or later.
upgrade:
  - |
    This version of the python-cinderclient no longer supports the Cinder v1
    API. Ensure all mananaged services have at least the v2 API available prior
    to upgrading this client.
  - |
    The ``cinder endpoints`` command was deprecated and has now been removed.
    The command ``openstack catalog list`` should be used instead.
  - |
    The ``cinder credentials`` command was deprecated and has now been removed.
    The command ``openstack token issue`` should be used instead.
  - |
    The use of ``--os_tenant_name``, ``--os_tenant_id`` and the environment
    variables ``OS_TENANT_NAME`` and ``OS_TENANT_ID`` have been deprecated
    for several releases and have now been removed. After upgrading, use the
    equivalent ``--os_project_name``, ``--os_project_id``, ``OS_PROJECT_NAME``
    and ``OS_PROJECT_ID``.
  - |
    The deprecated volume create option ``--allow-multiattach`` has now been
    removed. Multiattach capability is now controlled using `volume-type extra
    specs <https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/admin/blockstorage-volume-multiattach.html>`_.
  - |
    Support for the deprecated ``--sort_key`` and ``--sort_dir`` arguments have
    now been dropped. Use the supported ``--sort`` argument instead.
