    Automatic version negotiation for the cinderclient CLI.
    If an API version is not specified, the CLI will use the newest
    supported by the client and the server.
    If an API version newer than the server supports is requested,
    the CLI will fall back to the newest version supported by the server
    and issue a warning message.
    This does not affect cinderclient library usage.
