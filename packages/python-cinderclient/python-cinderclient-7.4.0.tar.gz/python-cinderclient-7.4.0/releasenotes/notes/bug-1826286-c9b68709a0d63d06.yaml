    The ``discover_version`` function in the ``cinderclient.api_versions``
    module was documented to return the most recent API version supported
    by both the client and the target Block Storage API endpoint, but it
    was not taking into account the highest API version supported by the
    client.  Its behavior has been corrected in this release.
