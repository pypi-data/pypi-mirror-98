    The Ussuri release of the python-cinderclient supports Block Storage
    API version 2 and Block Storage API version 3 through microversion
    3.60.  (The maximum microversion of the Block Storage API in the
    Ussuri release is 3.60.)

    In addition to the features and bugfixes described below, this release
    includes some documentation updates.

    Note that this release corresponds to a major bump in the version
    number.  See the "Upgrade Notes" section of this document for details.

    Please keep in mind that the minimum version of Python supported by
    this release is Python 3.6.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``--bypass-url`` command line argument, having been deprecated in
    version 2.10, was removed in version 4.0.0.  It was replaced by the
    command line argument ``--os-endpoint`` for consistency with other
    OpenStack clients.  In this release, the initializer functions for
    client objects no longer recognize ``bypass_url`` as a parameter name.
    Instead, use ``os_endpoint``.  This keeps the cinderclient consistent
    both internally and with respect to other OpenStack clients.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed an issue where the ``os_endpoint`` was not being passed to the
    keystone session as the ``endpoint_override`` argument.
