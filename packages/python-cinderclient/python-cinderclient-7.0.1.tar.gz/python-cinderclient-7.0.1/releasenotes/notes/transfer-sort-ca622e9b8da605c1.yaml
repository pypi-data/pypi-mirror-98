    Starting with microversion 3.59, the ``cinder transfer-list`` command now
    supports the ``--sort`` argument to sort the returned results. This
    argument takes either just the attribute to sort on, or the attribute and
    the sort direction. Examples include ``cinder transfer-list --sort=id`` and
    ``cinder transfer-list --sort=name:asc``.
