## Diffgram as your Training Data Database

Diffgram is all about Training Data:
Data that's ready to be used by AI systems.

It's created by combining raw data with human centered meaning. For example, combining an image with a box identifying an object. The encoded meaning can be relatively simple, for example a single bounding box, or complex, such as a time series video with a graph of attributes.

[Tell me moar](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/what-is-diffgram)

## Motivation

* An increase in complexity in annotations and frequency of data change.
* Organization between data, people and teams on larger scale projects.

[I need motivation](https://diffgram.readme.io/docs/why-choose-diffgram)

## Use Cases

* Create, Update, And Maintain Datasets
* Create processes for working with Deep Learning systems
* Compliance and threat actors
* Launch faster

#### Beta
Note the API/SDK is in beta and is undergoing rapid improvement. There may be breaking changes.
Please see the [API docs](https://diffgram.readme.io/reference) for the latest canonical reference 
and be sure to upgrade to latest ie: `pip install diffgram --upgrade`. We will attempt to keep the SDK up to date with the API.

[Help articles for Diffgram.com](https://diffgram.readme.io/)  See below for some examples.

Requires Python >=3.5

The default install through pip will install dependencies
for local prediction (tensorflow opencv) as listed in `requirements.txt`.
The only requirement needed for majority of functions is `requests`. 
If you are looking for a minimal size install and already have requests use
the `--no-dependencies` flag ie `pip install diffgram --no-dependencies`
