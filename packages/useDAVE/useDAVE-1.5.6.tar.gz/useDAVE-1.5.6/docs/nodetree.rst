Node-tree
===========

The node-tree can be used to change the relation between nodes by dragging and dropping.

Dragging node A onto node B will try to place B below A


*Any onto Axis*

This will set the parent of node B to node A

*Axis onto Empty area*

This will set the parent of the axis to None

*Circle onto Circle*

This will create a geometric contact between the two circles

*Circle onto Point*

Change parent of circle to that Point

*Point onto Point*

Create Cable?

*Circle onto Geometric Contact*

Replace the child connection of the geometric contact

*Geometric Contact onto circle*

Replace the parent connection of the geometric contact
