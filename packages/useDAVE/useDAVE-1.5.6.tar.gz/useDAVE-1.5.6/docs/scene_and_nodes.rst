Scene and nodes
================

How to set-up a scene using code
---------------------------------

This is the main module of the engine. It contains both the nodes and the scene.

    A node is an item or element in a model. For example a ship or a force.
    A Scene is a collection of nodes.

    The common way of working is as follows:

    1. Create a scene
    2. Add nodes to it

    Example:

    ::

        s = Scene()                               # create an empty scene
        s.new_poi('point 1')                      # creates a poi with name anchor
        s.new_poi('point 2', position = (10,0,0)) # create a second poi at x=10
        s.new_cable('line',poiA = 'point 1', poiB = 'point 2') # creates a cable between the two points
        s.save_scene(r'test.dave')                # save to file


    Nodes in a scene can be referenced by either name or by reference.
    The new_some_node_type functions return a reference to the newly created node.

    ::

        s = Scene()
        a = s.new_axis('axis')                     # a is now a reference to node 'axis'

        p1 = s.new_poi('poi_1', parent = a )       # refer by reference
        p2 = s.new_poi('poi_2', parent = 'axis' )  # refer by name


    A reference to a node can also be obtained from the scene using square brackets:

    ::

        s = Scene()
        s.new_axis('axis')

        a = s['axis']
        print(a.position)

       :py:func:`Buoyancy.trimesh`
     - 3D triangulated mesh for buoyancy calculations. Automatically created when a Bouyancy node is added.


Geometry is build using Axis systems, Rigid bodies and Pois.

Axis systems and rigid bodies have a position and an orientation.
Pois only have a position

All can be positioned on a parent. If a node has a parent then this means that its position and orientation are expressed relative to that parent.

Axis and RigidBodies can have all their six individual degrees of freedom either fixed or free. If a degree of freedom is free then this means that the
node is able to move/rotate in this degree of freedom.

If this is the first time you read this then please use the Gui to experiment.
