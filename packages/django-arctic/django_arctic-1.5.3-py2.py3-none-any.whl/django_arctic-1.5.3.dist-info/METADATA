Django Arctic
=============

|PyPi version| |Build Status| |Coverage Status| |Read the Docs|

Django Arctic is a framework that speeds up the creation of custom
content management systems. It provides a Bootstrap 4 based user
interface, role based authentication and a number of generic Django
Views that provide great looking and feature-rich lists and forms.

-  Lists support sorting, searching, links, nested fields, custom
   columns and data sources not only from databases but also from APIs
-  The Forms have enhanced widgets for DateTime, AutoComplete and
   MultiSelect and also support custom layouts without having to create
   extra templates.

Why
---

There are a lot of content management systems in the market that are a
good fit for the creation of many web sites. Most CMS's make assumptions
about the data model for posts, authentication and the administration
interface.

There is however a tipping point, where customizing a CMS product is so
extensive that it ends up being better to use some lower level
framework.

This is the case that Arctic wants to solve, creation of a CMS with a
high degree of customization. Instead of being a ready-to-use CMS,
Arctic is a framework that facilitates the construction of content
management systems.

-  Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9
