Description: # Molmag AC GUI
        
        Import `process_ac` to use in scripts with your own data.
        
        Install with
        ```
        python -m pip install molmag_ac_gui
        ```
        Run with
        ```
        python -m molmag_ac_gui
        ```
        
        To use the GUI for fitting relaxation times, your own file with data of (T, tau) can be loaded and fitted in the "Analysis"-tab
        when the file is formatted as (the header line is mandatory, but the content is of no importance)
        
        ```
        Temp;Tau
        T1;tau1(;dtau1)
        T2;tau2(;dtau2)
        T3;tau3(;dtau3)
        
        ...
        ```
        
        
        
        # v. 0.2.4:
        Published on 11/3/2021
        Quick fix to show Ueff in kelvin in the fitted parameters dialog
        
        # v. 0.2.3:
        Published on 11/3/2021
        Added a fit history so the last 10 fits can be retrived to see the parameters
        or use the parameters as starting guesses for new fits or to use the parameters
        to plot the simulation
        
        # v. 0.2.2:
        Published on 4/3/2021
        Adding a data-folder to hold static variables. This will also  
        make it easier in the future to add a function to change which  
        header values can be read by the interface.
        
        # v. 0.2.1:
        Published on 3/3/2021
        Changed fitting procedures so  
         - function to fit Xp and Xpp together is now in a separate function in process_ac
         - fitting of Xp and Xpp in the GUI is now done by multiprocessing
        
        # v. 0.2.0:
        Published on 1/3/2021
        Fixed issues relating to  
         - loading of PPMS-data (issue #8)
         - loading of T,tau-data (issue #5, issue #9)
         - calculation of diamagnetic corrections (issue #6)
         - now using matplotlib to handle color mapping (issue #11)
        
        # v. 0.1.10:
        Fixed issue with loading ACMS data files (issue #4 on Github)
        
        # v. 0.1.9:
        Fixed import issue in importing process_ac
        
        # v. 0.1.8:
        Removed a dependency on my own library of scientific constants and replaced with scipy.constants
