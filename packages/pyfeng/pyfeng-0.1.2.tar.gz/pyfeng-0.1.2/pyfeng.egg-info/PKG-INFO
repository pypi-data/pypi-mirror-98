Description: # PyFENG: Python Financial ENGineering
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyfeng.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pyfeng)
        
        PyFENG is the python implemention of the standard option pricing models in financial engineering.
          * Black-Scholes-Merton (and displaced diffusion)
          * Bachelier (Normal)
          * Constant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV)
          * Stochastic-alpha-beta-rho (SABR)
          * Hyperbolic normal stochastic volatility model (NSVh)
        
        ## About the package
        * It assumes variables are `numpy` arrays. So the computations are naturally vectorized.
        * It is purely in Python (i.e., no C, C++, cython). 
        * It is implemented with python class.
        * It is intended for, but not limited to, academic use. By providing reference models, it saves researchers' time.

        ## Code Snippets
        `In [1]:`
        ``` python
        import numpy as np
        import pyfeng as pf
        m = pf.Bsm(sigma=0.2, intr=0.05, divr=0.1)
        m.price(np.arange(80, 121, 10), 100, 1.2)
        ```
        `Out [1]:`
        ```
        array([15.71361973,  9.69250803,  5.52948546,  2.94558338,  1.48139131])
        ```
        
        `In [2]:`
        ``` python
        sigma = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])[:, None]
        m = pf.Bsm(sigma, intr=0.05, divr=0.1) # sigma in axis=0
        m.price(np.array([90, 100, 110]), 100, 1.2, cp=np.array([-1,1,1]))
        ```
        `Out [2]:`
        ```
        array([[ 5.75927238,  5.52948546,  2.94558338],
               [ 9.4592961 ,  9.3881245 ,  6.45745004],
               [16.812035  , 17.10541288, 14.10354768]])
