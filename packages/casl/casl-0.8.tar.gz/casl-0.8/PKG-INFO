Description: # NAME
        
        casl - simple implementation of CASL II assembler/COMET II simulator written in Python
        
        # WHAT IS CASL?
        
        *casl* is simple implementation of CASL II assembler and COMET II simulator
        written in Python.  The CASL II assembler and the COMET II simulator are
        designed for users to study principle operations of computers.  In particular,
        CASL II and COMET II are used in the qualifying examination called ``Japan
        Information-Technology Engineers Examination'' so that these programs should
        be valuable for people who would like to acquire this qualification.
        
        Since both the CASL II assembler and the COMET II simulator are written only
        in Python, these programs should work on almost all operating systems
        including UNIX flavors, Windows, and macOS.
        
        *casl* includes the following programs:
        
        * *casl* - a simple implementation of CASL II assembler
        * *comet* - a simple implementation of COMET II simulator
        
        # AVAILABILITY
