        ==========
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This python module perform pattern matching tasks on paths.
        
        Information about this module can be found here:
        
        * [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-pathpatternmatcher2)
        * [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_pathpatternmatcher2)
        
        Why this module?
        ----------------
        
        In various applications it is mandatory to scan for files in directory trees. Then often some files found need to be included in a selection, other files need to be excluded from a selection.
        
        For example such path matching is performed if you provide a file such as `.gitignore`. As you very likely will now this file is part of the `git` version control system. You specify paths in this file to exclude specific files and directories.
        
        This module `jk_pathpatternmatcher2` now mimiks this behavior. It is intended to be used in conjunction with recursive file and directory iteration processes.
        
        How this module works
        ---------------------
        
        This module achieves path matching by compiling a pattern to a regular expression. Then this regular expression is used to check paths specified to the matcher.
        
        Limitations of this module
        --------------------------
        
        For the moment this module is only capable of patterns applying to a normal path. By doing so only the path is in focus of any matching. Unlike in a `.gitignore` file this module does not distinguish between files or directories. Though such a feature might be implemented here in this module one day right now no distinction is made between files and directories per se: This module only knows one thing - paths - and therefore only matches paths (and not file paths or directory paths in particular).
        
        How to use this module
        ----------------------
        
        ### Import this module
        
        Please include this module into your application using the following code:
        
        ```python
        import jk_pathpatternmatcher2
        ```
        
        ### Compile a pattern
        
        Now a pattern can be compiled like this:
        
        ```python
        PATTERN = "src/**/*.py"
        
        pm = jk_pathpatternmatcher2.compilePattern(PATTERN)
        ```
        
        ### Use the matcher to check paths
        
        After having compiled a pattern you can match paths. Example:
        
        ```python
        PATH_TO_MATCH = "src/foo/bar.py"
        
        if pm.match(PATH_TO_MATCH):
        	print("We have a match!")
        else:
        	print("No match!")
        ```
        
        ### (Recursively) walking through directory trees
        
        This module provides a function named `walk(..)` that will traverse directory trees.
        
        In doing so `walk(..)` distinguishes between various directory entry types such as *files*, *directories*, *links* and *errors*. While files and directories do not need any further explanations, other aspects do:
        * By default instead of failing with an exception an *error* is returned if a directory is not readable. Sometimes you just want to ignore such entries. (To control that behavior you can modify option `emitErrorEntries` accordingly.)
        * By default soft links are recognized as links and returned as a *link*. This is imporant in directory traversals as you only want to follow "physical" members of a directory tree, not links. (Otherwise you might even end up in an endless loop if links are set inconveniently.)
        
        But `walk(..)` has more features:
        * `walk(..)` can return the root directory as an own directory entry if desired. In some applications this is very convenient therefore this can be configured by setting `emitBaseDirs` to `True`.
        * The files returned can automatically be sorted by name.
        * Without additional configuration `walk(..)` will return objects of type `Entry`. But you can derive from `Entry` and specify your own class: This way `walk(..)` will generate instances of your own type with all the methods you have defined in your class. So instead of getting `Entry` instances and maybe then in addition creating your own instances `walk(..)` will immediately provide *your* instances, therefore avoiding unnecessary loss of performance.
        
        Here is an example of how a simple traversal can be performed:
        
        ```python
        for e in walk(
        		"/my/github/project",
        		ignoreDirPathPatterns = [
        			".git",
        			".vscode",
        		],
        		emitDirs = False,
        		emitBaseDirs = False,
        	):
        	print(e)
        ```
        
        To learn more about the arguments for `walk(..)` see below in the API section.
        
        API
        ------------------
        
        ### walk()
        
        The function `walk(..)` will traverse directory trees. It is a *generatore* that will provide instances of `Entry` (or your own class). This function expectes the following arguments:
        
        * `*dirPaths` : (required) Provide one or more (!) directories here to traverse.
        * `str[] acceptDirPathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of directories to accept. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed. If not specified all directories are accepted by default.
        * `str[] acceptFilePathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of files to accept. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed. If not specified all files are accepted by default.
        * `str[] acceptLinkPathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of links to accept. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed. If not specified all links are accepted by default.
        * `str[] ignorePathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of files/directories/links to ignore. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed.
        * `str[] ignoreDirPathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of directories to ignore. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed.
        * `str[] ignoreFilePathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of files to ignore. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed.
        * `str[] ignoreLinkPathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of links to ignore. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed.
        * `bool emitDirs` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit directory entries. (This option is `True` by default.)
        * `bool emitFiles` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit file entries. (This option is `True` by default.)
        * `bool emitLinks` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit link entries. (This option is `True` by default.)
        * `bool emitBaseDirs` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit traversal root directory entries. (This option is `True` by default.)
        * `bool recursive` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will traverse recursively through the specified directory tree. (This option is `True` by default.)
        * `bool sort` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will sort all entries returns by name. (This option is `True` by default.)
        * `bool emitErrorEntries` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit error entries. If `false` exceptions are raised. (This option is `True` by default.)
        * `type clazz` : (optional) If a class is specified here instances of *this* class are instantiated instead of `Entry`.
        
        ### Entry
        
        Instances of `Entry` are returned by function `walk(..)`. Entries provide the following variables and/or properties:
        
        * `str baseDirPath` : The (absolute) base directory path of the current traversal
        * `str relPath` : The relative path of this file, directory or link
        * `str typeID` : A type identifier:
        	* "d" for directory
        	* "f" for file
        	* "l" for symbolic link
        	* "e" for error in reading a directory
        * `float mtime` : The last modification time of the file or link.
        * `int uid` : The owning user
        * `int gid` : The owning group
        * `int size` : The size of the file.
        * `Exception exception` : An exception object (if this is entry represents an error).
        * `str dirPath` : This is the directory the current entry resides in, An absolute path is returned here.
        * `str name` : The name of this entry
        * `str linkText` : Returns the link text stored at the link if this is a link. If this entry is not a link `None` is returned.
        * `str fullPath` : This is the absolute path of this entry.
        * `bool isBaseDir` : `True` if this is a base directory (and base directory only).
        * `bool isError` : `True` if this is an error entry.
        * `str group` : The name of the owning group
        * `str user` : The name of the owning user
        
        Additionally `Entry` will provide the following methods:
        
        * `void dump(str prefix = None, printFunc = None)` : Invoke `dump()` in order to quickly write the contents of this object so STDOUT.
        * `str __repr__()`
        * `str __str__()`
        
        If you want `walk(..)` to provide instances of your own class instead of `Entry`, inherit from `Entry`. If you need to overwrite the constructor method your code will need to be prepared for those arguments:
        
        * `str baseDirPath` : The (absolute) base directory path of the current traversal
        * `str relPath` : The relative path of this file, directory or link
        * `str typeID` : A type identifier:
        	* "d" for directory
        	* "f" for file
        	* "l" for symbolic link
        	* "e" for error in reading a directory
        * `float mtime` : The last modification time of the file or link.
        * `int uid` : The owning user
        * `int gid` : The owning group
        * `int size` : The size of the file.
        * `Exception exception` : An exception object (if this is entry represents an error).
