jk_pathpatternmatcher2
==========

Introduction
------------

This python module perform pattern matching tasks on paths.

Information about this module can be found here:

* [github.org](https://github.com/jkpubsrc/python-module-jk-pathpatternmatcher2)
* [pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jk_pathpatternmatcher2)

Why this module?
----------------

In various applications it is mandatory to scan for files in directory trees. Then often some files found need to be included in a selection, other files need to be excluded from a selection.

For example such path matching is performed if you provide a file such as `.gitignore`. As you very likely will now this file is part of the `git` version control system. You specify paths in this file to exclude specific files and directories.

This module `jk_pathpatternmatcher2` now mimiks this behavior. It is intended to be used in conjunction with recursive file and directory iteration processes.

How this module works
---------------------

This module achieves path matching by compiling a pattern to a regular expression. Then this regular expression is used to check paths specified to the matcher.

Limitations of this module
--------------------------

For the moment this module is only capable of patterns applying to a normal path. By doing so only the path is in focus of any matching. Unlike in a `.gitignore` file this module does not distinguish between files or directories. Though such a feature might be implemented here in this module one day right now no distinction is made between files and directories per se: This module only knows one thing - paths - and therefore only matches paths (and not file paths or directory paths in particular).

How to use this module
----------------------

### Import this module

Please include this module into your application using the following code:

```python
import jk_pathpatternmatcher2
```

### Compile a pattern

Now a pattern can be compiled like this:

```python
PATTERN = "src/**/*.py"

pm = jk_pathpatternmatcher2.compilePattern(PATTERN)
```

### Use the matcher to check paths

After having compiled a pattern you can match paths. Example:

```python
PATH_TO_MATCH = "src/foo/bar.py"

if pm.match(PATH_TO_MATCH):
	print("We have a match!")
else:
	print("No match!")
```

### (Recursively) walking through directory trees

This module provides a function named `walk(..)` that will traverse directory trees.

In doing so `walk(..)` distinguishes between various directory entry types such as *files*, *directories*, *links* and *errors*. While files and directories do not need any further explanations, other aspects do:
* By default instead of failing with an exception an *error* is returned if a directory is not readable. Sometimes you just want to ignore such entries. (To control that behavior you can modify option `emitErrorEntries` accordingly.)
* By default soft links are recognized as links and returned as a *link*. This is imporant in directory traversals as you only want to follow "physical" members of a directory tree, not links. (Otherwise you might even end up in an endless loop if links are set inconveniently.)

But `walk(..)` has more features:
* `walk(..)` can return the root directory as an own directory entry if desired. In some applications this is very convenient therefore this can be configured by setting `emitBaseDirs` to `True`.
* The files returned can automatically be sorted by name.
* Without additional configuration `walk(..)` will return objects of type `Entry`. But you can derive from `Entry` and specify your own class: This way `walk(..)` will generate instances of your own type with all the methods you have defined in your class. So instead of getting `Entry` instances and maybe then in addition creating your own instances `walk(..)` will immediately provide *your* instances, therefore avoiding unnecessary loss of performance.

Here is an example of how a simple traversal can be performed:

```python
for e in walk(
		"/my/github/project",
		ignoreDirPathPatterns = [
			".git",
			".vscode",
		],
		emitDirs = False,
		emitBaseDirs = False,
	):
	print(e)
```

To learn more about the arguments for `walk(..)` see below in the API section.

API
------------------

### walk()

The function `walk(..)` will traverse directory trees. It is a *generatore* that will provide instances of `Entry` (or your own class). This function expectes the following arguments:

* `*dirPaths` : (required) Provide one or more (!) directories here to traverse.
* `str[] acceptDirPathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of directories to accept. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed. If not specified all directories are accepted by default.
* `str[] acceptFilePathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of files to accept. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed. If not specified all files are accepted by default.
* `str[] acceptLinkPathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of links to accept. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed. If not specified all links are accepted by default.
* `str[] ignorePathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of files/directories/links to ignore. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed.
* `str[] ignoreDirPathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of directories to ignore. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed.
* `str[] ignoreFilePathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of files to ignore. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed.
* `str[] ignoreLinkPathPatterns` : (optional) If specfied these are patterns of links to ignore. Patterns are relative to the base directory traversed.
* `bool emitDirs` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit directory entries. (This option is `True` by default.)
* `bool emitFiles` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit file entries. (This option is `True` by default.)
* `bool emitLinks` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit link entries. (This option is `True` by default.)
* `bool emitBaseDirs` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit traversal root directory entries. (This option is `True` by default.)
* `bool recursive` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will traverse recursively through the specified directory tree. (This option is `True` by default.)
* `bool sort` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will sort all entries returns by name. (This option is `True` by default.)
* `bool emitErrorEntries` : (optional) If `True` function `walk(..)` will emit error entries. If `false` exceptions are raised. (This option is `True` by default.)
* `type clazz` : (optional) If a class is specified here instances of *this* class are instantiated instead of `Entry`.

### Entry

Instances of `Entry` are returned by function `walk(..)`. Entries provide the following variables and/or properties:

* `str baseDirPath` : The (absolute) base directory path of the current traversal
* `str relPath` : The relative path of this file, directory or link
* `str typeID` : A type identifier:
	* "d" for directory
	* "f" for file
	* "l" for symbolic link
	* "e" for error in reading a directory
* `float mtime` : The last modification time of the file or link.
* `int uid` : The owning user
* `int gid` : The owning group
* `int size` : The size of the file.
* `Exception exception` : An exception object (if this is entry represents an error).
* `str dirPath` : This is the directory the current entry resides in, An absolute path is returned here.
* `str name` : The name of this entry
* `str linkText` : Returns the link text stored at the link if this is a link. If this entry is not a link `None` is returned.
* `str fullPath` : This is the absolute path of this entry.
* `bool isBaseDir` : `True` if this is a base directory (and base directory only).
* `bool isError` : `True` if this is an error entry.
* `str group` : The name of the owning group
* `str user` : The name of the owning user

Additionally `Entry` will provide the following methods:

* `void dump(str prefix = None, printFunc = None)` : Invoke `dump()` in order to quickly write the contents of this object so STDOUT.
* `str __repr__()`
* `str __str__()`

If you want `walk(..)` to provide instances of your own class instead of `Entry`, inherit from `Entry`. If you need to overwrite the constructor method your code will need to be prepared for those arguments:

* `str baseDirPath` : The (absolute) base directory path of the current traversal
* `str relPath` : The relative path of this file, directory or link
* `str typeID` : A type identifier:
	* "d" for directory
	* "f" for file
	* "l" for symbolic link
	* "e" for error in reading a directory
* `float mtime` : The last modification time of the file or link.
* `int uid` : The owning user
* `int gid` : The owning group
* `int size` : The size of the file.
* `Exception exception` : An exception object (if this is entry represents an error).
