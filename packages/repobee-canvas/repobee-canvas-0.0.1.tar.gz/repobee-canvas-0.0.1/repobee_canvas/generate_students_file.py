    """RepoBee command to generate a students file from a Canvas assignment.

    The CanvasStudentsFile class is a RepoBee plugin to generate a students file
    for a Canvas assignment: All students assigned to this assignment are
    listed and written to the students file. If the assignment is a group
    assignment, the student groups are written instead.

    You have to use this plugin first to generate the students file and then use
    the student file to create and manage student repositories. See the Canvas
    plugin below for more information.

    Because the login ids of students can be different in Canvas and git, a
    mapping needs to be made via a database containing both login ids for each
    student. This database should be a csv file and have a canvas_id and git_id
    column.


    Usage:

    Assunming the course id, Canvas API URL, and Canvas API key have been
    configured, the command

    ```
    repobee -p canvas generate-students-file \
            --canvas-assignment-id 23 \
            --canvas-git-map student_data.csv
    ```

    will generate file `students.lst` with all Git account names of the
    students involved in assignment with ID=23.

    If you want to use a different output filename use option
    `--canvas-students-file output.lst`.
