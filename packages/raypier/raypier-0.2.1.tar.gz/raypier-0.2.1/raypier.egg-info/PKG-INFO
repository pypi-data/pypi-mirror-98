Description: =========================================================
        Raypier - A Non-sequential optical ray-tracing framework
        =========================================================
        
        Raypier is a non-sequential ray-tracing framework for modelling optical systems. Its main features are:
        
        #. It's pretty fast. The tracing algorithms are written in Cython (i.e. C) and use efficient data-structures for handling many thousands of rays.
        #. Correctly handles polarisation
        #. Support for dispersion including a comprehensive library of glass-types (taken from refractive-index.info)
           and diffraction-gratings
        #. Point Spread Function (PSF) and E-Field evaluation by summation of of Gaussian modes.
        #. Paraxial Gaussian mode evaluation covers generally astigmatic modes.
        #. Tracing support for conics section and general aspherics (conic + polnomial)
        #. An interactive user-interface with 3D model/ray rendering through VTK. Tracing is performed "live".
        #. A modest selection of optic-types including singlet and achromatic doublet lenses (with AR coating), plane-mirrors, 
           ellipsoidal mirrors, prisms
        #. STEP model/trace export for integration with external CAD systems
          
        There are still a few "big" features missing:
        
        #. The documentation is not comprehensive (yet).
        
          
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Raypier requires:
        
        * python-3.6 (older versions work on 2.7) 
        * numpy
        * scipy
        * traits / traitsui
        * Cython
        * Mayavi (for TVTK) / VTK
        * (Optionally) PythonOCC - for STEP export
        * (Optionally) Chaco / Enable - for integrating line-plots into the UI
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The best way to install and run Raypier is using a Conda environment. 
        
        #. Install miniconda (or the full Anaconda distribution)
        #. Create a fresh conda-environment using the environment.yml file included 
           in this raypier repo.
