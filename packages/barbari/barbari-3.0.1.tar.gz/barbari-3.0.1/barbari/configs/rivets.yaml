  A configuration using copper wire vias,
  10mm deep alignment holes, [voltera 1mm rivets](https://www.voltera.io/store/consumables/rivets-1-0mm)
  for holes near 1mm, and milled holes
  larger than 1.1mm.  Note that holes being drilled
  for voltera rivets will be drilled at 1.5mm to allow
  clearance for the rivets.
