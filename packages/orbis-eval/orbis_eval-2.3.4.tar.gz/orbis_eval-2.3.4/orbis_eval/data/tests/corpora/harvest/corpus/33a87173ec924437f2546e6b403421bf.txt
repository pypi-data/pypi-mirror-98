Only...I'm downloading a torrent with a total of 73GB and everytime uTorrent starts up it is checking the files so you get the status 'checked ...%' This takes a lot of CPU and time because it is 73GB to be checked! Can I disable the check at start up? * Share this post Link to post Share on other sites      * [ ](https%3A%2F%2Fforum.utorrent.com%2Ftopic%2F23012-check-on-startup%2F%3Fdo%3DfindComment%26comment%3D158142)  [ DreadWingKnight ](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/628-dreadwingknight/) 307 [ ](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/628-dreadwingknight/) [DreadWingKnight](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/628-dreadwingknight/) 307 * ------- * [ ](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/628-dreadwingknight/) * Administrators * 307 * 43,158 posts Report post  Posted July 25, 2007 comment-158145 You can't disable it, but you can prevent it by fixing whatever it is that is preventing uT from saving its resume data. * Share this post Link to post Share on other sites      * [ ](https%3A%2F%2Fforum.utorrent.com%2Ftopic%2F23012-check-on-startup%2F%3Fdo%3DfindComment%26comment%3D158145)  [RobMan](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/21061-robman/) 0 [ ](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/21061-robman/) [RobMan](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/21061-robman/) 0 * Newbie * [ ](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/21061-robman/) * Members * 0 * 5 posts Report post  Posted July 25, 2007 comment-158146 Could you explain what you mean with: ''but you can prevent it by fixing whatever it is that is preventing uT from saving its resume data.''

They need to either allow the write or be removed. Non-graceful shutdowns of uTorrent also prevent the writing of the resume file. Make sure uT shuts down cleanly. * Share this post Link to post Share on other sites      * [ ](https%3A%2F%2Fforum.utorrent.com%2Ftopic%2F23012-check-on-startup%2F%3Fdo%3DfindComment%26comment%3D158158)  [RobMan](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/21061-robman/) 0 [ ](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/21061-robman/) [RobMan](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/21061-robman/) 0 * Newbie * [ ](https://forum.utorrent.com/profile/21061-robman/) * Members * 0 * 5 posts Report post  Posted July 26, 2007 comment-158296 Thanks * Share this post Link to post Share on other sites      * [ ](https%3A%2F%2Fforum.utorrent.com%2Ftopic%2F23012-check-on-startup%2F%3Fdo%3DfindComment%26comment%3D158296)   Go To Topic Listing       * [ ](https%3A%2F%2Fforum.utorrent.com%2Ftopic%2F23012-check-on-startup%2F)  All Activity  Home  uTorrent (for Windows)  General  * check on startupContact Us Powered by Invision Community [ × ](#)Existing user?
