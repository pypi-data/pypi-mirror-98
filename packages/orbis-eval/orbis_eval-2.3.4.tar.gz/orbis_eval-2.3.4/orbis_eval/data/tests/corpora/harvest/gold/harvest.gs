Only...I'm downloading a torrent with a total of 73GB and everytime uTorrent starts up it is checking the files so you get the status 'checked ...%' This takes a lot of CPU and time because it is 73GB to be checked! Can I disable the check at start up?

They need to either allow the write or be removed. Non-graceful shutdowns of uTorrent also prevent the writing of the resume file. Make sure uT shuts down cleanly.
