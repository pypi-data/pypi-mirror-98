- [ ] Did you add a regression test?
- [ ] Does the commit message include a "Fixes #issue_number" (replace "issue_number").
- [ ] Does this PR add, rename, move or remove any existing functions or parameters?

For new functionality:

- [ ] Did you add an entry to the "Changes.rst" file?
- [ ] Did you include a meaningful docstring with Parameters, Returns and Examples?
- [ ] Does the commit message include a "Fixes #issue_number" (replace "issue_number").
- [ ] Did you include tests for the new functionality?
- [ ] Does this PR add, rename, move or remove any existing functions or parameters?
