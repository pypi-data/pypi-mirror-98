This is the template for bug reports, if you have a feature request or question
you can safely ignore and delete this prefilled text.

Include a description of the problem: What are you trying to do (include your
code and the **full** traceback)? What did you expect?

```
Include a minimal example to reproduce the issue including output and
traceback. The triple backticks make github render this as a multi-line code
block.
```

Don't forget to include the version of astropy, ccdproc and numpy, just copy
this into your Python interpreter (without the backticks):

```
import astropy
print(astropy.__version__)
import ccdproc
print(ccdproc.__version__)
import numpy
print(numpy.__version__)
```
