Description: Coop - base for all (most) Neon Jungle sites
        ============================================
        
        This is a base to build all Neon Jungle sites off.
        This package contains all the common code shared
        between sites, with the ideal Neon Jungle site containing only
        model definitions, templates, and front end assets.
        
        Making a release
        ----------------
        
        Upgrade the version in ``coop/_version.py``.
        Coops version stays in step with Wagtail. i.e. Coop 2.4.x uses Wagtail 2.4.x.
        Point releases are used to add features during a Wagtail version lifespan.
        
        Update the CHANGELOG. Please.
        
        Tag your release:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ git tag "x.y.z"
            $ git push --tags
        
        And you are done! Gitlab is set up to automatically push the new package to pypi when a tag is pushed.
