        The Optimizer.

    ----------
    optimizer: Optimizer
        The Optimizer.

    initial_pulses: numpy array, shape (num_init, num_t, num_ctrl)
        The initial pulse. Where num_init is the number of initial pulses.

    processes: int, optional
        If an integer is given, then the propagation is calculated in
        this number of parallel processes. If 1 then no parallel
        computing is applied. If None then cpu_count() is called to use
        all cores available. Defaults to None.

        A DataContainer in which the OptimizationResults are saved.
