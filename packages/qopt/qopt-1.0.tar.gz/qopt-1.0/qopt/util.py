"""
Utility functions for the optimal control package.

Functions
---------
:func:`deprecated` decorator
    Marks functions and methods which are deprecated.

:func:`needs_refactoring` decorator
    Marks objects which need refactoring.

:func:`timeit` decorator
    Measures the run time of a function evaluation.

:func:`closest_unitary`
    Calculates the closest unitary matrix to a square matrix.

Notes
-----
The implementation was inspired by the optimal control package of QuTiP [1]_
(Quantum Toolbox in Python)
