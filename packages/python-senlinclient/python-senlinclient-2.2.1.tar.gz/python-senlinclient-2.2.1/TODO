High Priority
=============

  - Support action_cancel
  - Add support to HTTPS connection
    * This means a cert and key option using plain HTTP package, while
      it means using Transport when we switched to OpenStackSDK
  - Add checking for token based authentication
  - Add CLI argument checking, required vs optional

Middle Priority
===============

  - Use code from https://review.opendev.org/#/c/95679/ to replace
    _append_global_identity_args(parser)
  - Add unit tests
  - Figure out how to use access_info and reauthenticate parameters for
    authentication.
  - Support trust based authentication

Low Priority
