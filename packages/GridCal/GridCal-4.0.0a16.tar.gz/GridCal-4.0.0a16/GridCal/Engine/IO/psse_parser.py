            When MODSW is 1 or 2, SWREM is entered as 0 if the switched shunt is to regulate
            its own voltage; otherwise, SWREM specifies the remote Type 1 or 2 bus where
            voltage is to be regulated by this switched shunt
            When MODSW is 3, SWREM specifies the Type 2 or 3 bus where plant reactive
            power output is to be regulated by this switched shunt. Set SWREM to I if the
            switched shunt and the plant that it controls are connected to the same bus.

            for which the admittance setting is to be regulated by this switched shunt is
            connected.

        RDC	    The dc line resistance; entered in ohms. No default allowed.

        SETVL	Current (amps) or power (MW) demand. When MDC is one, a positive value of SETVL specifies desired power
                at the rectifier and a negative value specifies desired inverter power. No default allowed.

        VSCHD	Scheduled compounded dc voltage; entered in kV. No default allowed.

        VCMOD	Mode switch dc voltage; entered in kV. When the inverter dc voltage falls below this value and the
                line is in power control mode (i.e., MDC = 1), the line switches to current control mode with a desired
                current corresponding to the desired power at scheduled dc voltage. VCMOD = 0.0 by default.

        RCOMP	Compounding resistance; entered in ohms. Gamma and/or TAPI is used to attempt to hold the compounded
                voltage (VDCI + DCCURRCOMP) at VSCHD. To control the inverter end dc voltage VDCI, set RCOMP to zero;
                to control the rectifier end dc voltage VDCR, set RCOMP to the dc line resistance, RDC; otherwise,
                set RCOMP to the appropriate fraction of RDC. RCOMP = 0.0 by default.

        TAPR	Rectifier tap setting. TAPR = 1.0 by default.

        If no two-winding transformer is specified by IFR, ITR, and IDR, TAPR is adjusted to keep alpha within limits;
        otherwise, TAPR is held fixed and this transformer’s tap ratio is adjusted. The adjustment logic assumes that
        the rectifier converter bus is on the Winding 2 side of the transformer. The limits TMXR and TMNR specified
        here are used; except for the transformer control mode flag (COD1 of Transformer Data), the ac tap adjustment
        data is ignored.

        IDR	    Circuit identifier; the branch described by IFR, ITR, and IDR must have been entered as a two-winding
                transformer; an ac transformer may control at most only one dc converter.
                IDR = '1' by default.

                by ACSET.

        REMOT   is entered as zero if the converter is to regulate its own voltage. Not used if MODE = 2.

                RMPCT must be positive.
                RMPCT is needed only if REMOT specifies a valid remote
                bus and there is more than one local or remote voltage controlling device (plant, switched shunt, FACTS
                device shunt element, or VSC dc line converter) controlling the voltage at bus REMOT to a setpoint, or
                REMOT is zero but bus IBUS is the controlled bus, local or remote, of one or more other setpoint mode
                voltage controlling devices.
                Not used if MODE = 2.

            2 for winding voltage in kV
            3 for off-nominal turns ratio in pu of nominal winding voltage, NOMV1, NOMV2 and NOMV3.

            (NOMV1). For three-phase transformers or three-phase banks of single phase
            transformers, MAG1 should specify the three-phase no-load loss. When a non-zero
            MAG2 is specified, it should be entered as a positive quantity.

            in pu on Winding 1 to 2 MVA base (SBASE1-2) and winding voltage base. For
            three-phase transformers or three-phase banks of single phase transformers, R1-2
            should specify the three-phase load loss.
            R1-2 = 0.0 by default, but no default is allowed for X1-2.
        SBASE1-2 The Winding 1 to 2 three-phase base MVA of the transformer. SBASE1-2 = SBASE

            three-phase transformers or three-phase banks of single phase transformers, R2-3
            should specify the three-phase load loss.
            R2-3 = 0.0 by default, but no default is allowed for X2-3.
        SBASE2-3 The Winding 2 to 3 three-phase base MVA of a three-winding transformer; ignored
            for a two-winding transformer. SBASE2-3 = SBASE (the system base MVA) by

            three-phase transformers or three-phase banks of single phase transformers, R3-1
            should specify the three-phase load loss.
            R3-1 = 0.0 by default, but no default is allowed for X3-1.
        SBASE3-1 The Winding 3 to 1 three-phase base MVA of a three-winding transformer; ignored

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        All data items on the third record are read for both two- and three-winding transformers:

        WINDV1: When CW is 1, WINDV1 is the Winding 1 off-nominal turns ratio in pu of Winding 1
            bus base voltage; WINDV1 = 1.0 by default.
            When CW is 2, WINDV1 is the actual Winding 1 voltage in kV; WINDV1 is equal to
            the base voltage of bus I by default.
            When CW is 3, WINDV1 is the Winding 1 off-nominal turns ratio in pu of nominal
            Winding 1 voltage, NOMV1; WINDV1 = 1.0 by default.
        NOMV1 The nominal (rated) Winding 1 voltage base in kV, or zero to indicate that nominal
            Winding 1 voltage is assumed to be identical to the base voltage of bus I. NOMV1 is
            used in converting magnetizing data between physical units and per unit admittance
            values when CM is 2. NOMV1 is used in converting tap ratio data between values in
            per unit of nominal Winding 1 voltage and values in per unit of Winding 1 bus base
            voltage when CW is 3. NOMV1 = 0.0 by default.
        ANG1 The winding one phase shift angle in degrees. For a two-winding transformer,
            ANG1 is positive when the winding one bus voltage leads the winding two bus
            voltage; for a three-winding transformer, ANG1 is positive when the winding one
            bus voltage leads the T (or star) point bus voltage. ANG1 must be greater than -

            RATC1 = 0.0 (bypass loading limit check for this transformer winding) by default.
        COD1 The transformer control mode for automatic adjustments of the Winding 1 tap or
            phase shift angle during power flow solutions:
                0 for no control (fixed tap and fixed phase shift)
                ±1  for voltage control
                ±2  for reactive power flow control
                ±3  for active power flow control
                ±4  for control of a dc line quantity (valid only for two-winding  transformers)
                ±5  for asymmetric active power flow control.
            If the control mode is entered as a positive number, automatic adjustment of this
            transformer winding is enabled when the corresponding adjustment is activated
            during power flow solutions; a negative control mode suppresses the automatic
            adjustment of this transformer winding. COD1 = 0 by default.

        CONT1: The bus number, or extended bus name enclosed in single quotes (refer to
            Extended Bus Names), of the bus for which voltage is to be controlled by the trans-
            former turns ratio adjustment option of the power flow solution activities when
            COD1 is 1. CONT1 should be non-zero only for voltage controlling transformer
            windings.
            CONT1 may specify a bus other than I, J, or K; in this case, the sign of CONT1
            defines the location of the controlled bus relative to the transformer winding. If
            CONT1 is entered as a positive number, or a quoted extended bus name, the ratio
            is adjusted as if bus CONT1 is on the Winding 2 or Winding 3 side of the trans-
            former; if CONT1 is entered as a negative number, or a quoted extended bus name
            with a minus sign preceding the first character, the ratio is adjusted as if bus
            |CONT1| is on the Winding 1 side of the transformer. CONT1 = 0 by default.
        RMA1, RMI1:  When |COD1| is 1, 2 or 3, the upper and lower limits, respectively, of one of the
            following:
            • Off-nominal turns ratio in pu of Winding 1 bus base voltage when |COD1| is
            1 or 2 and CW is 1; RMA1 = 1.1 and RMI1 = 0.9 by default.

            • Phase shift angle in degrees when |COD1| is 3. No default is allowed.
            Not used when |COD1| is 0 or 4; RMA1 = 1.1 and RMI1 = 0.9 by default.
        VMA1, VMI1:  When |COD1| is 1, 2 or 3, the upper and lower limits, respectively, of one of the
            following:
            • Voltage at the controlled bus (bus |CONT1|) in pu when |COD1| is 1. 
            VMA1 = 1.1 and VMI1 = 0.9 by default.
            • Reactive power flow into the transformer at the Winding 1 bus end in Mvar
            when |COD1| is 2. No default is allowed.
            • Active power flow into the transformer at the Winding 1 bus end in MW when
            |COD1| is 3. No default is allowed.
            Not used when |COD1| is 0 or 4; VMA1 = 1.1 and VMI1 = 0.9 by default.
        NTP1: The number of tap positions available; used when COD1 is 1 or 2. NTP1 must be
            between 2 and 9999. NTP1 = 33 by default.

            winding’s impedance is to be a function of either off-nominal turns ratio or phase
            shift angle (refer to Transformer Impedance Correction Tables), or 0 if no trans-
            former impedance correction is to be applied to this transformer winding. TAB1 = 0
            by default.
        CR1, CX1: The load drop compensation impedance for voltage controlling transformers

            by default.
        CNXA1: Winding connection angle in degrees; used when COD1 is 5. There are no restrictions
            on the value specified for CNXA1; if it is outside of the range from -90.0 to

        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        The first two data items on the fourth record are read for both two- and three-winding transformers;
        the remaining data items are used only for three-winding transformers:

        WINDV2:  When CW is 1, WINDV2 is the Winding 2 off-nominal turns ratio in pu of Winding 2
            bus base voltage; WINDV2 = 1.0 by default.
            When CW is 2, WINDV2 is the actual Winding 2 voltage in kV; WINDV2 is equal to
            the base voltage of bus J by default.
            When CW is 3, WINDV2 is the Winding 2 off-nominal turns ratio in pu of nominal
            Winding 2 voltage, NOMV2; WINDV2 = 1.0 by default.
        NOMV2 The nominal (rated) Winding 2 voltage base in kV, or zero to indicate that nominal
            Winding 2 voltage is assumed to be identical to the base voltage of bus J. NOMV2
            is used in converting tap ratio data between values in per unit of nominal Winding 2
            voltage and values in per unit of Winding 2 bus base voltage when CW is 3.
            NOMV2 = 0.0 by default.
        ANG2 The winding two phase shift angle in degrees. ANG2 is ignored for a two-winding
            transformer. For a three-winding transformer, ANG2 is positive when the winding
            two bus voltage leads the T (or star) point bus voltage. ANG2 must be greater than
            -180.0o and less than or equal to +180.0o. ANG2 = 0.0 by default.
        RATA2, RATB2, RATC2: Winding 2’s three three-phase ratings, entered in either MVA or current expressed
            as MVA, according to the value specified for XFRRAT specified on the first data
            record (refer to Case Identification Data). RATA2 = 0.0, RATB2 = 0.0 and
            RATC2 = 0.0 (bypass loading limit check for this transformer winding) by default.
        COD2: The transformer control mode for automatic adjustments of the Winding 2 tap or
            phase shift angle during power flow solutions:
                0    for no control (fixed tap and fixed phase shift)
                ±1   for voltage control
                ±2   for reactive power flow control
                ±3   for active power flow control
                ±5   for asymmetric active power flow control
            If the control mode is entered as a positive number, automatic adjustment of this
            transformer winding is enabled when the corresponding adjustment is activated
            during power flow solutions; a negative control mode suppresses the automatic
            adjustment of this transformer winding. COD2 = 0 by default.
        CONT2:  The bus number, or extended bus name enclosed in single quotes (refer to
            Extended Bus Names), of the bus for which voltage is to be controlled by the trans-
            former turns ratio adjustment option of the power flow solution activities when
            COD2 is 1. CONT2 should be non-zero only for voltage controlling transformer
            windings.
            CONT2 may specify a bus other than I, J, or K; in this case, the sign of CONT2
            defines the location of the controlled bus relative to the transformer winding. If
            CONT2 is entered as a positive number, or a quoted extended bus name, the ratio
            is adjusted as if bus CONT2 is on the Winding 1 or Winding 3 side of the trans-
            former; if CONT2 is entered as a negative number, or a quoted extended bus name
            with a minus sign preceding the first character, the ratio is adjusted as if bus
            |CONT2| is on the Winding 2 side of the transformer. CONT2 = 0 by default.

        RMA2, RMI2:  When |COD2| is 1, 2 or 3, the upper and lower limits, respectively, of one of the
            following:
            • Off-nominal turns ratio in pu of Winding 2 bus base voltage when |COD2| is

            VMA2 = 1.1 and VMI2 = 0.9 by default.
            • Reactive power flow into the transformer at the Winding 2 bus end in Mvar
            when |COD2| is 2. No default is allowed.
            • Active power flow into the transformer at the Winding 2 bus end in MW when
            |COD2| is 3. No default is allowed.
            Not used when |COD2| is 0; VMA2 = 1.1 and VMI2 = 0.9 by default.
        NTP2 The number of tap positions available; used when COD2 is 1 or 2. NTP2 must be
            between 2 and 9999. NTP2 = 33 by default.

            winding’s impedance is to be a function of either off-nominal turns ratio or phase
            shift angle (refer to Transformer Impedance Correction Tables), or 0 if no trans-
            former impedance correction is to be applied to this transformer winding. TAB2 = 0
            by default.
        CR2, CX2 The load drop compensation impedance for voltage controlling transformers
            entered in pu on system base quantities; used when COD2 is 1. CR2 + j CX2 = 0.0
            by default.
        CNXA2 Winding connection angle in degrees; used when COD2 is 5. There are no restrictions
            on the value specified for CNXA2; if it is outside of the range from -90.0 to
            +90.0, CNXA2 is normalized to within this range. CNXA2 = 0.0 by default.
            The fifth data record is specified only for three-winding transformers:
        WINDV3: When CW is 1, WINDV3 is the Winding 3 off-nominal turns ratio in pu of Winding 3
            bus base voltage; WINDV3 = 1.0 by default.
            When CW is 2, WINDV3 is the actual Winding 3 voltage in kV; WINDV3 is equal to
            the base voltage of bus K by default.
            When CW is 3, WINDV3 is the Winding 3 off-nominal turns ratio in pu of nominal
            Winding 3 voltage, NOMV3; WINDV3 = 1.0 by default.

        NOMV3 The nominal (rated) Winding 3 voltage base in kV, or zero to indicate that nominal
            Winding 3 voltage is assumed to be identical to the base voltage of bus K. NOMV3
            is used in converting tap ratio data between values in per unit of nominal Winding 3
            voltage and values in per unit of Winding 3 bus base voltage when CW is 3. NOMV3
            = 0.0 by default.

            three bus voltage leads the T (or star) point bus voltage. ANG3 must be greater
            than -180.0o and less than or equal to +180.0o. ANG3 = 0.0 by default.

            as MVA, according to the value specified for XFRRAT specified on the first data
            record (refer to Case Identification Data). RATA3 = 0.0, RATB3 = 0.0 and
            RATC3 = 0.0 (bypass loading limit check for this transformer winding) by default.
        COD3 The transformer control mode for automatic adjustments of the Winding 3 tap or
            phase shift angle during power flow solutions:
            0    for no control (fixed tap and fixed phase shift)
            ±1   for voltage control
            ±2   for reactive power flow control
            ±3   for active power flow control
            ±5   for asymmetric active power flow control.

            If the control mode is entered as a positive number, automatic adjustment of this
            transformer winding is enabled when the corresponding adjustment is activated
            during power flow solutions; a negative control mode suppresses the automatic
            adjustment of this transformer winding. COD3 = 0 by default.
        CONT3:   The bus number, or extended bus name enclosed in single quotes (refer to
            Extended Bus Names), of the bus for which voltage is to be controlled by the trans-
            former turns ratio adjustment option of the power flow solution activities when
            COD3 is 1. CONT3 should be non-zero only for voltage controlling transformer
            windings.
            CONT3 may specify a bus other than I, J, or K; in this case, the sign of CONT3
            defines the location of the controlled bus relative to the transformer winding. If

            NAME must be enclosed in single or double quotes if it contains any blanks or
            special characters. No default allowed.

        I Sending end bus number, or extended bus name enclosed in single quotes (refer to

        J Terminal end bus number, or extended bus name enclosed in single quotes; 0 for a
            STATCON. J = 0 by default.

        MODE Control mode:
            For a STATCON (i.e., a FACTS devices with a shunt element but no series
            element), J must be 0 and MODE must be either 0 or 1):
            0 out-of-service (i.e., shunt link open)
            1 shunt link operating.
                For a FACTS device with a series element (i.e., J is not 0), MODE may be:
                0 out-of-service (i.e., series and shunt links open)

                another FACTS device must be designated as the slave device
                (i.e., its MODE is 6 or 8) of this IPFC.
            6 slave device of an IPFC with P and Q setpoints specified;
                the FACTS device specified in MNAME must be the master
                device (i.e., its MODE is 5 or 7) of this IPFC. The Q setpoint is
                ignored as the master device dictates the active power
                exchanged between the two devices.
            7 master device of an IPFC with constant series voltage setpoints
                specified; another FACTS device must be designated as the slave

                the active power exchange determined by the master device
            MODE = 1 by default.

        PDES Desired active power flow arriving at the terminal end bus; entered in MW.
            PDES = 0.0 by default.
        QDES Desired reactive power flow arriving at the terminal end bus; entered in MVAR.
            QDES = 0.0 by default.

        VSET Voltage setpoint at the sending end bus; entered in pu. VSET = 1.0 by default.

        RMPCT Percent of the total Mvar required to hold the voltage at the bus controlled by the
            shunt element of this FACTS device that are to be contributed by this shunt
            element; RMPCT must be positive. RMPCT is needed only if REMOT specifies a
            valid remote bus and there is more than one local or remote voltage controlling
            device (plant, switched shunt, FACTS device shunt element, or VSC dc line
            converter) controlling the voltage at bus REMOT to a setpoint, or REMOT is zero
            but bus I is the controlled bus, local or remote, of one or more other setpoint mode
            voltage controlling devices. RMPCT = 100.0 by default.
            OWNER Owner number (1 through 9999). OWNER = 1 by default.

        SET1, SET2
            If MODE is 3, resistance and reactance respectively of the constant impedance,
            entered in pu; if MODE is 4, the magnitude (in pu) and angle (in degrees) of the
            constant series voltage with respect to the quantity indicated by VSREF; if MODE is
            7 or 8, the real (Vd) and imaginary (Vq) components (in pu) of the constant series
            voltage with respect to the quantity indicated by VSREF; for other values of MODE,
            SET1 and SET2 are read, but not saved or used during power flow solutions.
            SET1 = 0.0 and SET2 = 0.0 by default.

        VSREF Series voltage reference code to indicate the series voltage reference of SET1 and
            SET2 when MODE is 4, 7 or 8:
                0 for sending end voltage
                1 for series current.

        VSREF = 0 by default.

        REMOT Bus number, or extended bus name enclosed in single quotes (refer to Extended
            Bus Names), of a remote Type 1 or 2 bus where voltage is to be regulated by the
            shunt element of this FACTS device to the value specified by VSET. If bus REMOT
            is other than a Type 1 or 2 bus, the shunt element regulates voltage at the sending
            end bus to the value specified by VSET. REMOT is entered as zero if the shunt
            element is to regulate voltage at the sending end bus and must be zero if the
            sending end bus is a Type 3 (swing) bus. REMOT = 0 by default.

        MNAME The name of the FACTS device that is the IPFC master device when this FACTS
            device is the slave device of an IPFC (i.e., its MODE is specified as 6 or 8). MNAME
            must be enclosed in single or double quotes if it contains any blanks or special characters.
            MNAME is blank by default.
