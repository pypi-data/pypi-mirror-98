class Filter:
    """A string conforming to a *limited* set of the filtering operations described in [Google AIP 160](https://google.aip.dev/160).

    * Expressions are always of the form `{field} {operator} {value}` and may be grouped with `()` and joined with `AND` or `OR`.
    * Fields are specific to the route in question, but are typically a subset of attributes of the requested resource.
    * Operators are limited to `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `!=`.
    * Values may take the following forms:
      * `true` or `false` for boolean fields
      * a number
      * a string (include surrounding `"`s),
      * a duration string (include surrounding `"`s). Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
      * a date string (include surrounding `"`s). Should be formatted [RFC3339 5.6](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).

    For example, `startTime >= "2020-06-24T22:00:00.000Z" OR (duration >= "15m" AND endTime < "2020-06-24T22:00:00.000Z")`.
