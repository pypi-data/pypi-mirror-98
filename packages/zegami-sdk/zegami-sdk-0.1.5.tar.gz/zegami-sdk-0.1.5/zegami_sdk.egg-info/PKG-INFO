        # zegami-python-sdk
        An SDK and general wrapper for the lower level Zegami API for Python. This package provides higher level collection interaction and data retrieval.
        
        # Getting started
        Grab this repo, open the script, and load an instance of ZegamiClient into a variable.
        
        ```
        from zegami_sdk.zegami_client import ZegamiClient
        
        zc = ZegamiClient(username, login)
        ```
        
        ## Credentials
        The client operates using a user token. By default, logging in once with a valid username/password will save the acquired token to your home directory as
        `zegami.token`. The next time you need to use ZegamiClient, you may call `zc = ZegamiClient()` with no arguments, and it will look for this stored token.
        
        ## Example Usage
        ### Get the metadata and images associated with every dog of the 'beagle' breed in a collection of dogs:
        ```
        zc = ZegamiClient()
        
        # By default, the client will look for collections in your default workspace.
        # You can manually provide another workspace ID to look there instead.
        
        # Grab the collection (a dictionary of information)
        dogs_collection = zc.get_collection_by_name('My dogs collection')
        
        # Get a pandas.DataFrame of the data in the collection, filtering to only
        # items whose 'Breed' column == 'beagle'
        beagles = zc.get_rows_by_filter(dogs_collection, { 'Breed' : 'beagle' })
        
        # Get the image URLs associated with these rows
        beagles_urls = zc.get_image_urls(dogs_collection, beagles)
        
        # Download those images (into memory)
        beagles_imgs = zc.download_image_batch(beagles_urls)
        ```
        
        # In Development
        This SDK is in active development, not all features are available yet. Creating/uploading to collections is not supported currently - check back soon!
