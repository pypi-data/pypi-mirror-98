Description: # scikit-sdr
        
        **scikit-sdr** is a Python 3 library that provides algorithms for building digital communication systems and for experimenting with DSP and SDR.
        The structure of the library is as follows:
        
        - ``sksdr``:&nbsp;source code for algorithms
        - ``tests``:&nbsp;units tests using the pytest framework
        - ``demo``:&nbsp;demonstrations using Jupyter notebooks
        - ``gnuradio``:&nbsp;GNU Radio wrappers contained in an OOT module (``gnuradio/gr-grsksdr``) and some demonstration flowgraphs (``gnuradio/demo``)
        - ``docs``:&nbsp;Sphinx documentation
        
        Some of this work as been inspired and/or based of other libraries such as [komm](https://github.com/rwnobrega/komm) and [scikit-dsp-comm](https://github.com/mwickert/scikit-dsp-comm). Other sources include the books:
