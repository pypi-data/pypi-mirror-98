class AGC:

    AGC based on a logarithmic scheme.

    The algorithm doesn't use a linear loop scheme since that has a significant drawback: The time constant of the loop is input signal level dependent, and is different depending on whether the input signal is increasing or decreasing. These properties drastically reduce the control over the system's time constant. To solve this problem, a logarithmic loop is adopted. This allows complete control of the AGC's time constant, increases its dynamic range and generally provides good performance for a variety of signal types. For the logarithmic AGC scheme, the feedback loop's time constant is dependent solely on :attr:`det_gain` and independent of the input signal level.

    The detector block is composed of a low-pass filter (LPF) to eliminate rapid gain changes. That filter can be a simple moving average filter, a cascaded integrator-comb (CIC) filter, or a more traditional LPF having a sinc-shaped impulse response. In the current implementation, a moving average filter is implemented, which computes the average power of the last :attr:`avg_len` samples. This power is then multiplied by the loop gain :math:`g(n)` and compared with the reference power :math:`A` (specified by :attr:`ref_power`) in natural log units, to produce the error signal :math:`e(n)`. This error signal is scaled by the detector gain :math:`K` (specified by :attr:`det_gain`) and passed to an integrator  which updates the loop gain :math:`g(n)`. Mathematically, the algorithm is summarized as:

    TODO equation

    where:

    * :math:`x(n)` is the input signal,
    * :math:`y(n)` is the output signal,
    * :math:`g(n)` is the loop gain, in Neper
    * :math:`D()` is the detector function,
    * :math:`z(n)` is the detector output,
    * :math:`e(n)` is the error signal,
    * :math:`A` is the reference value, given by :attr:`ref_power`,
    * :math:`K` is the detector gain, given by :attr:`det_gain`

    The detector function :math:`D(\ldots)` is implemented as a moving average filter:

    TODO equation

    where :math:`N` is the number of samples to average, given by :attr:`avg_len`

    .. rubric:: AGC Performance Criteria

    * Attack time: The duration it takes the AGC to respond to an increase in the input amplitude
    * Decay time: The duration it takes the AGC to respond to a decrease in the input amplitude
    * Gain pumping: The variation in the gain value during steady-state operation

    Increasing the step size decreases the attack time and decay times, but it also increases gain pumping.
