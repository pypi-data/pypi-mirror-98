    Compensates for carrier frequency and phase offsets in signals in BPSK and QPSK.

    The algorithm is a closed loop synchronizer that uses the discrete phase-locked loop (PLL) based algorithm described in :cite:`rice08`.
    The maximum likelihood (ML) phase error detector (PED) is chosen, which consists of minimizing the energy in :math:`\theta_e` . It also has the advantage of avoiding arctangent operations required by other phase detectors based on a purely geometric The ML phase detector first de-rotates the input signal by the estimated phase from the DDS output (CCW rotation block). This leaves only the phase of the received data symbol :math:`\theta_r = \theta-\hat\theta`. It then subtracts the phase of the transmitted data symbol to obtain the phase error, :math:`\theta_e=\theta_r-\theta_d` . This is usually used in a data-aided system, in which there is a training sequence where the transmission symbols are well known. If the symbols are unknown then it is called a decision-directed system and the transmitted symbols must be estimated.
