        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This python module provides parser and validator for JSON files and data structures.
        
        The JSON parser is designed as a drop-in replacement for the built in python JSON parser as this parser here supports using comments in JSON files (which in some use cases is very a very handy feature).

        Why a replacement?
        ------------------
        
        For two reasons:
        
        1. The existing JSON library does report errors in the data format very well.
        2. The existing JSON library can't cope with comments. Unfortunately comments in JSON files are a very nice thing.
