        # OCT file converter #
        
        This repository contains code for extracting the raw optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus data from 
        manufacturer's proprietary file formats. 
        
        ## Motivation
        Research in ophthalmology is often hindered by manufacturer's usage of proprietary data formats for storing their data. 
        For example, until recently, the ~200,000 OCT scans in the UK Biobank project was only available in Topcon's .fds
        file format, which prevented bulk processing and analysis. The only freely available software that allows these scans
        to be accessed is  [uocte](https://bitbucket.org/uocte/uocte/wiki/Home), which is written in C++ and is no longer 
        maintained. This repository aims to make available python-based tools for reading these proprietary formats.
        
        
        ## Supported file formats
        * .fds (Topcon)
        * .fda (Topcon)
        * .e2e (Heidelberg)
        * .img (Zeiss)
        * .dcm
        
        ## Installation
        Requires **python3**.
        
        ```bash
        pip install oct-converter
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        A number of example usage scripts are included in examples/. 
        
        Here is an example of reading a .fds file:
        
        ```python
        from oct_converter.readers import FDS
        
        # An example .fds file can be downloaded from the Biobank website:
        # https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=30
        filepath = '/home/mark/Downloads/eg_oct_fds.fds'
        fds = FDS(filepath)
        
        oct_volume = fds.read_oct_volume()  # returns an OCT volume with additional metadata if available
        oct_volume.peek() # plots a montage of the volume
        oct_volume.save('fds_testing.avi')  # save volume as a movie
        oct_volume.save('fds_testing.png')  # save volume as a set of sequential images, fds_testing_[1...N].png
        
        fundus_image = fds.read_fundus_image()  # returns a  Fundus image with additional metadata if available
        fundus_image.save('fds_testing_fundus.jpg')
        ```

        ## Updates
        30 October 2020
        - Extract fundus and laterality data from .e2e
        - Now attempts to extract additional volumetric data from .e2e files that was previously missed
        
        22 August 2020
        - Experimental support for reading OCT data from .fda files. 
        
        14 July 2020
        - Can now read fundus data from .fda files.
