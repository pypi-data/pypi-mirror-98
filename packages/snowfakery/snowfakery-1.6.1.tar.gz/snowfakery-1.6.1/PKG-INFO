Description: # Snowfakery Documentation
        
        Snowfakery is a tool for generating fake data that has relations between tables. Every row is faked data, but also unique and random, like a snowflake. 
        
        To tell Snowfakery what data you want to generate, you need to write a Recipe file in YAML.
        
        Snowfakery can write its output to stdout, or any database accessible to SQLAlchemy. **When it is embedded in CumulusCI it can output to a Salesforce org**. Adding new output formats is fairly straightforward and open source contributions of that form are gratefully accepted.
