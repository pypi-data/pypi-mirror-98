`sdmx` is an `Apache 2.0-licensed <LICENSE>`_ Python package that implements `SDMX <http://www.sdmx.org>`_ 2.1 (`ISO 17369:2013 <https://www.iso.org/standard/52500.html>`_), a format for exchange of **statistical data and metadata** used by national statistical agencies, central banks, and international organisations.

`sdmx` can be used to:

- explore the data available from `data providers <https://sdmx1.rtfd.io/en/latest/sources.html>`_ such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Eurostat, OECD, and United Nations;
- parse data and metadata in SDMX-ML (XML) or SDMX-JSON formats—either:

  - from local files, or
  - retrieved from SDMX web services, with query validation and caching;

- convert data and metadata into `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org>`_ objects, for use with the analysis, plotting, and other tools in the Python data science ecosystem;
- apply the `SDMX Information Model <https://sdmx1.rtfd.io/en/latest/api.rst#api-model>`_ to your own data;

…and much more.
