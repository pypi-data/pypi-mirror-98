Description: The *FlexMeasures Platform* is a tool for scheduling flexible actions for energy assets.
        For this purpose, it performs monitoring, forecasting and scheduling services.
        
        FlexMeasures is fully usable via APIs, which are inspired by the Universal Smart Energy Framework (USEF).
        Some algorithms are included, but projects will usually write their own (WIP).
        
        Energy Flexibility is one of the key ingredients to reducing CO2. FlexMeasures is meant
        to facilitate the transition to a carbon-free energy system. By open-sourcing FlexMeasures,
        we hope to speed up this transition world-wide.
