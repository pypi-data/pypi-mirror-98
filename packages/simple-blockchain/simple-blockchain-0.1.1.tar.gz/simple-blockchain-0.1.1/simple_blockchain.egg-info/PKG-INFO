Description: # Simplified Blockchain
        
        This simplified model of a blockchain was created to help students understand the blockchain technology, which is also the technology behind the well known crypto-currency Bitcoin.
        
        ## How to use
        Create your own blockchain in 3 easy steps.
        
        ### 1. Create blockchain
        ```python
        blockchain = Blockchain()
        ```
        ### 2. Add transactions
        ```python
        transaction_1 = Transaction("Aleksander Sadowski", "Wiktor Domaradzki", 1.00)
        transaction_2 = Transaction("Aleksander Sadowski", "Wiktor Domaradzki", 2.50)
        transaction_3 = Transaction("Wiktor Domaradzki", "Aleksander Sadowski", 3.50)
        blockchain.add_transactions([transaction_1, transaction_2, transaction_3])
        ```
        ### 3. Display blockchain
        ```python
        blockchain.display()
        ```
