    """This class defines the capabilities of an LMS connected using LTI 1.3.

    An important note about naming in this class: most of the attribute names
    are not really intuitive. For example: *supporting* `set_deadline`1
    classes, and 2) it describes what you can do inside CodeGrade with the LMS,
    maybe it is in the future possible to sync back the deadline to the LMS,
    and in this case the name `set_deadline` makes way more sense.
    """

    #: The name of the LMS.
    lms: "str"
    #: Is it possible for users to set the deadline of a CodeGrade assignment
    #: within CodeGrade?  This should be `True` if the LMS does **not** pass
    #: the deadline in the LTI launch, and `False` otherwise.
    set_deadline: "bool"
    #: Same as `set_deadline` but for the `lock_date` date.
    set_lock_date: "bool"
    #: Should the state of the assignment be set within CodeGrade and not be
    #: copied from the LMS?  If `False` users are not allowed to change to
    #: state of the assignment within CodeGrade (they can always set the state
    #: to done).
    set_state: "bool"
    #: Should the `available_at` of the assignment be set within CodeGrade and
    #: not be copied from the LMS?
    set_available_at: "bool"
    #: If there is a test student in the lms this its full name.
    test_student_name: "Optional[str]"
    #: The name of the iframe `postMessage` If set to `None` this LMS doesn't
    #: have any post message that will allow us to send cookies (this is
    #: currently the case for all LMSes except `Canvas`).
    cookie_post_message: "Optional[str]"
    #: A list of replacements groups (or namespaces) supported by this LMS.
    #: Some LMSes support more replacement variables than others, however we
    #: don't want to send replacement variables to an LMS we know it will never
    #: support. This property contains a list of custom replacement groups
    #: supported by this LMS.  For example: we have a replacement variable
    #: called `name'`, this variable will be included (parsed and returned as
    #: wanted config), if the `supported_custom_replacement_groups` contains
    #: `['$com']`. It will also be included if it contains `['$com',
    #: 'custom_lms']` However, it will not be included if it only contains
    #: `['$com.custom_lms']` or `['$com', 'other_lms']`.
    supported_custom_replacement_groups: "Sequence[Sequence[str]]"
    #: Should we use the `id` in the url.  Some LMSes do not provide both the
    #: `iss` and the `client_id` This means that finding the correct
    #: `LTI1p3Provider` is not always correct (especially as the `iss` often
    #: gets used multiple times). For some LMSes therefore it is a better idea
    #: to simply include the id of the provider in the launch url, and verify
    #: with the given information that the provider could theoretically be the
    #: correct one (i.e. all given information matches with the information in
    #: the LTI provider that belongs to the `id`).

    #: Does this LMS require actual deep linking, where the user inputs a name
    #: and deadline.
    actual_deep_linking_required: "bool"
    #: Is it required to set a separate OAuth2 Audience for this LMS before we
    #: can finalize it.
