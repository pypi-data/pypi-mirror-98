A tool for creating and testing epidemiological models faster than ever for the mathematical modeling of infectious 
diseases. An idea from https://github.com/henrifroese/infectious_disease_modelling.

## Installation

Epispot can be installed via pip or via Anaconda.
If using pip, install with:
```
pip install epispot
```
For Anaconda, use:
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install -c conda-forge epispot
```

As a shorthand, use `import epispot as epi`.

You can also install the `epispot-nightly` package from pip:
``` bash
pip install epispot-nightly
```
You can import it the same as `import epispot as epi`. Both packages cannot be used at the same time.

## Getting Started

Check the guides and tutorials found
in the `tests/tutorials` folder. All tutorials will have a `.md` file
followed by a corresponding code file. If you get stuck, don't understand 
something, or just need to reference the documentation, per-class 
documentation can be found at https://epispot.github.io/epispot. You may also find 
it helpful to see the examples in the `tests/examples` folder.

Documentation can easily be accessed from function, class, and file docstrings.
Doc strings provide additional documentation on a certain function.
They can be accessed by the built-in Python `help()` command.
These strings are formatted in Github-flavored markdown.
Additionally, all files will have a 'STRUCTURE' label.
