class EnergyConsumptionModel:
    """
    Calculate energy consumption of a vehicle for a given driving cycle and vehicle parameters.

    Based on a selected driving cycle, this class calculates the acceleration needed and provides
    two methods:

        - :func:`~energy_consumption.EnergyConsumptionModel.aux_energy_per_km` calculates the energy needed to power auxiliary services
        - :func:`~energy_consumption.EnergyConsumptionModel.motive_energy_per_km` calculates the energy needed to move the vehicle over 1 km

    Acceleration is calculated as the difference between velocity at t_2 and velocity at t_0, divided by 2.
    See for example: http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2012/wp29grpe/WLTP-DHC-12-07e.xls
