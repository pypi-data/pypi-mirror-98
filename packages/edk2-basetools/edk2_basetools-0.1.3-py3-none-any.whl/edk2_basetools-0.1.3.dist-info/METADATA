# Tianocore Edk2 Python BaseTools (edk2basetools)

This is a Tianocore maintained project consisting of a the python source files that make up EDK2 basetools. This package's intent is to provide an easy way to organize and share python code to facilitate reuse across environments, tools, and scripts.  Inclusion of this package and dependency management is best managed using Pip/Pypi.

This is a fundamental package and is required to be used for edk2 builds.

## How to use it

As it stands right now, this isn't hosted on PyPi, so it needs to be installed locally.

1. Clone the repo locally
2. Run `pip install -e .` (you might need do this from an admin prompt in windows)
4. Run edk2_build to make sure it works
3. Switch to an EDK2 basetools that has the necessary hooks

Right now the only EDK2 that supports this package is https://github.com/matthewfcarlson/edk2/tree/feature/pip-basetools
This commit: https://github.com/matthewfcarlson/edk2/commit/40bb4778f5edb380c38233399507d00dd47df80d gives you a good idea of how to enable it for your repo if need to enable it.

## Content

The package contains classes and modules that can be used as the building blocks of tools that are relevant to UEFI firmware developers.  These modules should attempt to provide generic support and avoid tightly coupling with specific use cases.  It is expected these modules do not provide direct interaction with the user (through command line interfaces) but instead are intended to be wrapped in other scripts/tools which contains the specific usage and interface.

Examples:

* File parsers for edk2 specific file types.  These parse the file and provide an object for interacting with the content.
* UEFI specific services for encoding/decoding binary structures.
* UEFI defined values and interfaces for usage in python
* Python wrappers for other system cli tools ( signtool, catalog file generation, inf file generation, etc)
* Python utilities to provide consistent logging, command invocation, path resolution, etc

## Usage

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you use python virtual environments.  Virtual environments avoid changing the global python workspace and causing conflicting dependencies.  Virtual environments are lightweight and easy to use.  [Learn more](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

* To install run `pip install --upgrade edk2-pytool-base`
* To use in your python code

    ```python
    from edk2basetools.<module> import <class>
    ```
