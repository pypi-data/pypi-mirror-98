# Fishybot ESO
Auto fishing bot for Elder Scrolls Online. The Bot automatically fishes until the fishing hole disappears.  It can also send a notification to the users phone with the statistics of that fishing hole.

It's not a fully automated bot, it does fishing on its own but you will have to move from one hole to another manually (although I was developing a fully automated bot, I didn't get a positive feedback from the community so I discontinued it).

Botting does violate ESO's terms of service, so technically you could get banned. But this bot doesn't read or write memory from ESO so they won't know you are using a bot. **This software doesn't come with any Liability or Warranty, I am not responsible if you do get banned.**
