   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Python bindings to the Aodh API
===============================

This is a client for Aodh API. There's :doc:`a Python API
<api>` (the :mod:`aodhclient` module), and a :doc:`command-line script
<shell>` (installed as :program:`aodh`). Each implements the entire
Aodh API.

.. warning::

   This is a new client to interact with Aodh API. There may be differences
   in functionality, syntax, and command line output when compared with the
   alarm functionality provided by ceilometerclient.


.. seealso::

    You may want to read the `Aodh Developer Guide`__  -- the overview, at
    least -- to get an idea of the concepts. By understanding the concepts
    this library should make more sense.
