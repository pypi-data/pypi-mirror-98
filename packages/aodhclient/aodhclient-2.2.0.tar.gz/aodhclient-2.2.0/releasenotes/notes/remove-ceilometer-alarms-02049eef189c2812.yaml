features:
  - |
    Ceilometer alarms are no longer supported.
upgrade:
  - |
    Ceilometer alarms will need to be recreated as alarms that target Gnocchi
    as storage is not provided in Ceilometer anymore. You must downgrade client
    if you still continue to use Ceilometer storage in older deployments.
