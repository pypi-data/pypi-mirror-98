Description: 
        A set of python modules implementing treaps in pure python is provided.
        
        See also my pyx_treap module, which implements treaps in Cython.
        
        Treaps perform most operations in O(log2(n)) time, and are innately sorted.
        They're very nice for keeping a collection of values that needs to
        always be sorted, or for optimization problems in which you need to find
        the p best values out of q, when p is much smaller than q.
        
        A module is provided for treaps that enforce uniqueness.
        
        Example use:
        ```
        $ python3
