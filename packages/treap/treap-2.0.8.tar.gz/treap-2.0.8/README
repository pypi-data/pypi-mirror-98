This package implements a treap-based dictionary-like interface for Python.

This is the pure Python version; the other is a Cython version which is
in the pyx_treap pypi package.

The pure Python version may actually be a bit faster at about 100,000
values, but the Cython version is vastly faster for larger collections.

The nest.py module is a quick demo of what you might use a treap for.  It
keeps the n lowest (or n highest) values from a potentially large series of
values.

Courtesy of Zaar Hai, on pickling the cython version::
	>>> import treap
	>>> import cPickle
	>>> t = treap.treap()
	>>> t[1] = 1
	>>> cPickle.dumps(t, protocol=2)
