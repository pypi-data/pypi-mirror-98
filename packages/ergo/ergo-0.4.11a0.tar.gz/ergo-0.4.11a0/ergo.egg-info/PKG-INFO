Description: # ERGO
        ## Simple Microservice Development Framework
        
        Ergo is the substrate for the rapid development of coordinated microservices.
        
        The primary emphasis with Ergo is to eliminate - as much as possible - the boilerplate infrastructure that is common to most software stacks to facilitate a larger developer emphasis on business-oriented development.  This is achieved with inversion of control and procedural injection.
        
        For example; Consider the following python function in a file `math.py`:
        
        ```
        # math.py
        
        def product(x, y):
            return float(x) * float(y)
        ```
        
        Ergo provides the tooling to bootstrap this simple function into any one of a variety of environments (eg. console application, http service, MQ worker, etc.)
        
        To start an http service for the above function:
        
        ```
        $ ergo http math.py:product
        ```
        
        then to make a request against this service
        
        ```
        $ curl -i "http://localhost?4&5"
        {"result": 20.0}
        ```
