# SITI: Spatial Information / Temporal Information

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/siti.svg)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/siti)

[![Python package](https://github.com/slhck/siti/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/slhck/siti/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

A command-line-based tool to calculate spatial information (SI) and temporal information (TI) according to ITU-T P.910.

The command outputs SI and TI information to stdout, in JSON format, or alternatively as CSV.

This program internally uses the [`siti-tools` library](https://github.com/Telecommunication-Telemedia-Assessment/siti-tools).

Author: Werner Robitza

**Important Note / Breaking Changes:**

* Version 1.4 does not include the 0 TI value for global statistics calculation
* Version 1.3 fixes an issue with border handling, now returning values that should better match ITU-T Rec. P.910. Thanks to Cosmin Stejerean for raising these issues.
* Version 1.x now outputs the same number of values for SI and TI, inserting a null value for the first frame's TI. Also, the output format has been changed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- FFmpeg libraries (to run `pyav`)

Under Ubuntu, to get ffmpeg libraries:

    sudo apt install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libavfilter-dev libswscale-dev libavresample-dev

Under macOS, it is recommended to install ffmpeg via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

    brew install ffmpeg

## Installation

Run:

    pip3 install --user siti

Alternatively, clone this repository and then:

    pip3 install --user .

## Usage

Simply run `siti /path/to/file.mp4`.

Detailed usage:

```
siti [-h] [-of {json,csv}] [-q] [-n NUM_FRAMES] [--width WIDTH] [--height HEIGHT] input

positional arguments:
  input                 input file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -of {json,csv}, --output-format {json,csv}
                        output format
  -q, --quiet           do not show progress bar
  -n NUM_FRAMES, --num-frames NUM_FRAMES
                        number of frames to calculate
  --width WIDTH         frame width (for YUV files)
  --height HEIGHT       frame height (for YUV files)
  -f, --full-range      assume full range for YUV input
```

## Background

The following info is given about SI / TI in ITU-T Recommendation P.910 ("Subjective video quality assessment methods for multimedia applications"):

### Spatial Information

> The spatial perceptual information (SI) is based on the Sobel filter. Each video frame (luminance plane) at time n (Fn) is first filtered with the Sobel filter [Sobel(Fn)]. The standard deviation over the pixels (stdspace) in each Sobel-filtered frame is then computed. This operation is repeated for each frame in the video sequence and results in a time series of spatial information of the scene. The maximum value in the time series (maxtime) is chosen to represent the spatial information content of the scene. This process can be represented in equation form as:

### Temporal information

> The temporal perceptual information (TI) is based upon the motion difference feature, Mn(i, j), which is the difference between the pixel values (of the luminance plane) at the same location in space but at successive times or frames. Mn(i, j) as a function of time (n) is defined as:

> ![](http://i.imgur.com/MRsJtdT.png)

> here Fn(i, j) is the pixel at the ith row and jth column of nth frame in time.
The measure of temporal information (TI) is computed as the maximum over time (maxtime) of the standard deviation over space (stdspace) of Mn(i, j) over all i and j.

> More motion in adjacent frames will result in higher values of TI
