# StitchM
StitchM stitches together mosaic images taken in Cockpit (Micron)
into a universally readable format, currently '.ome.tiff'.

The current output is an 16bit greyscale image when stitching the mosaic.
Markers exported from Cockpit can be added as rectangular ROIs within the OME
metadata stored in the image header. ROIs can be imported and displayed using
bioformats in FIJI/ImageJ.

## Installation
Using pip: `python -m pip install StitchM`
Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/StitchM/) and [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/stitchm-feedstock)

## Using StitchM:
To use command line script: `StitchM --help` and `StitchM setup --help` to get options and info
To import into python: `import stitch_m` or `from stitch_m import stitch_and_save, stitch, save` depending on usage


## Motivation
To make a mosaic image that can be easily viewed and can be used for automatic 
alignment with a separate grid image (using gridSNAP).

## Features
- [x] Creates tiff from .txt file that links to a .mrc
- [x] Applies exposure compensation from .txt file values
- [x] Slight exposure trimming to remove extreme highlights
- [x] Image normalisation
- [x] OME-TIFF metadata
- [x] Supports regions of interests (ROIs) if markers have been placed and exported to a separate .txt file
- [x] Drag and drop (.bat) processing of a single mosaic (accepts additional ROI file, not batch processing)
- [x] Filtering to attempt to remove fluorecence images (optional in config file)
- [x] Logging level for log file and terminal interface can be separately set in config file
- [x] Command line script interface ("StitchM -h" for details)
- [x] Python module entry point (`python -m stitch_m *args*`)
- [x] Python package (main functions for import `from stitch_m import stitch_and_save, stitch, save`)
