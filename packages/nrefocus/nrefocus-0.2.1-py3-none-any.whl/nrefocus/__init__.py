"""
This package provides methods for numerical propagation of a complex
wave in free space. The available propagators are the angular spectrum
method (`helmholtz`) and the Fresnel approximation (`fresnel`). Both
implementations are convolution-based. The angular spectrum method is
suited for near-field propagation (numerical focusing) and yields
better results than the Fresnel approximation.
The single Fourer transform-based Fresnel propagation method which is
suitable for far-field propagation is not implemented in this package.
