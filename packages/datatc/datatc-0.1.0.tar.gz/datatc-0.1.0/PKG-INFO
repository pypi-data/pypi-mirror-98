        Whhrrrr... Voooooosh... That's the sound of your data coming and going exactly where it belongs
        
        ## What is it?
        **data traffic control** is a python package that automates every-day interactions with your data files. 
        Data files are the building materials we work with *every day, all day*. Working with them should be *effortless*.
        
        ## Main Features
        
        * Navigate your data directories with ease, without having to memorize long file paths.
        * Load data files without having to think about it (or looking it up the syntax yet again).
        * Be certain of how a datafile was generated, and rest easy knowing you could reproduce it. 
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install datatc
        ```
