Description: Convenience functions for constructing shell commands
        
        *Latest release 20210316*:
        Minor doc update.
        
        Functions for safely constructing shell command lines from bare strings.
        Somewhat like the inverse of the shlex stdlib module.
        
        As of Python 3.3 the function `shlex.quote()` does what `quotestr()` does.
        
        As of Python 3.8 the function `shlex.join()` does what `quotecmd()` does.
        
        ## Function `main_shqstr(argv=None)`
        
        shqstr: emit shell-quoted form of the command line arguments.
        
        ## Function `quote(args)`
        
        Quote the supplied strings, return a list of the quoted strings.
        
        As of Python 3.8 the function `shlex.join()` is available for this.
        
        ## Function `quotecmd(argv)`
        
        Quote strings, assemble into command string.
        
        ## Function `quotestr(s)`
        
        Quote a string for use on a shell command line.
        
        As of Python 3.3 the function `shlex.quote()` is available for this.
