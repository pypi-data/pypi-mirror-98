CHANGES
=======

v1.0.5
------

* Pycsou's documentation now lists extensions Pycsou-gsp and Pycsou-sphere
* Updated requirements and graph routines moved to extension module pycsou-gsp
* Added some common green functions + extended linear operator MappedDistanceMatrix to non Hilbertian distances induced by arbitrary Minkowski norms
* Added some common green functions
* Fix for the computation of Lipschitz constants of operators which are deficient (non diagonalizable). PMYULA implemented but not documented yet (currently being validated). Added a postprocess method to class GenericIterativeAlgorithm
* Removed verbose ipynb files from linguist scope to avoid biasing language statistics
* Improved documentation and proximal MCMC schemes
