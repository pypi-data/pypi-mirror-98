py2exe for Python 3
===================

`py2exe` is a distutils extension which allows to build standalone
Windows executable programs (32-bit and 64-bit) from Python scripts.
Python versions included in the  official development cycle are supported
(from 3.6 to 3.9 included). `py2exe` can build console executables
and windows (GUI) executables. Building windows services, and DLL/EXE
COM servers might work but it is not actively supported.

Development of `py2exe` is hosted here:
https://github.com/py2exe/py2exe.
