Description: # CytoHMM
        
        Hidden Markov models for cytogenetic microarrays.  Will be copying
        code from the repository Markov-models over here.  Then later it will
        be moved.
        
        At this point primarily Affymetrix arrays are addressed.  There is no
        reason why Illumina microarrays couldn't use this code.
