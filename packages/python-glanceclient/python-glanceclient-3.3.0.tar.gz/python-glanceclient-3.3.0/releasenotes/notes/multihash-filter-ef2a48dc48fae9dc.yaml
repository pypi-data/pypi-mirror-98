    For parity with the old ``checksum`` field, this release adds the
    ability for CLI users to filter the image list based upon a particular
    multihash value using the ``--hash <HASH_VALUE>`` option.  Issue the
    command:

    .. code-block:: none

        glance help image-list

    for more information.
