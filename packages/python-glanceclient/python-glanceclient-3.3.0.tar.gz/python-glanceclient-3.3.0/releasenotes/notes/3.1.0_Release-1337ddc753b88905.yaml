    The following Command Line Interface calls now take ``--stores``,
    ``--all-stores`` and ``--allow-failure`` option:

    * ``glance image-create-via-import``
    * ``glance image-import``

    The value for ``--stores`` option is a list of store identifiers.  The
    list of available stores may be obtained from the ``glance stores-info``
    command.

    The value for ``--all-stores`` option could be True or False.

    The value for ``--allow-failure`` option could be True or False.
