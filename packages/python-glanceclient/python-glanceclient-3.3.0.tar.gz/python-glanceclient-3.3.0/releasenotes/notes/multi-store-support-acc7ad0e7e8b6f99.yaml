    This release adds client support for the Glance feature
    `multi-store backend support
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/approved/glance/multi-store.html>`_,
    introduced in the Rocky release.  This feature allows end users
    to direct uploaded or imported image data to a particular backend
    when a cloud operator has configured the Image Service to use multiple
    backends.

    The available backends are discoverable by making the ``stores-info``
    call, which will return a list of available backends.  The list contains
    an identifier (``id``) and a ``description`` of each available
    backend.  The default backend is indicated in this response.

    When uploading or importing an image, the glanceclient now accepts
    the ``--backend`` option.  Its value must be the ``id`` of a backend
    configured in the cloud against which the call is being made.  This
    option may also be configured by exporting the ``OS_IMAGE_BACKEND``
    environment variable with the ``id`` of a configured backend as its
    value.

    Some other points to keep in mind:

    - If no backend is specified, the image data is stored in the
      default backend.
    - If the version of the Image Service API contacted does not
      support multi-store backends, the option is silently ignored
      and the image data is stored in the default backend.
    - If an invalid backend identifier is used, the glanceclient will
      exit with an error message.
    - Backend identifiers and their meanings are unique to each cloud.
      Consult the ``stores-info`` call and your cloud provider's
      documentation for details.
