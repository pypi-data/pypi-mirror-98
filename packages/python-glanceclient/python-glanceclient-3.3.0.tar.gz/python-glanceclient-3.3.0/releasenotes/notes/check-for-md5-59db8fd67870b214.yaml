   For legacy (pre-Rocky) images that do not contain "multihash" metadata,
   or when the ``--allow-md5-fallback`` option is used in cases where the
   multihash metadata is present but the specified algorithm is not available
   to the glanceclient, the glanceclient uses an MD5 checksum to validate
   the download.  When operating in a FIPS-compliant environment, however,
   the MD5 algorithm may be unavailable to the glanceclient. In such a case,
   (that is, when the MD5 checksum information is available to the glanceclient
   but the MD5 algorithm is not), the glanceclient will fail the download as
   corrupt because it cannot prove otherwise.  This is consistent with
   current behavior.
