    Bug 1766235_: Handle HTTP headers per RFC 8187

    Previously the glanceclient encoded HTTP headers as UTF-8
    bytes.  According to `RFC 8187`_, however, headers should be
    encoded as 7-bit ASCII.  The glanceclient now sends all headers
    as 7-bit ASCII.  It handles unicode strings by percent-encoding_
    them before sending them in headers.
