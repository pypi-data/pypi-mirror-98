    This release adds client support for the Glance "hidden images"
    feature described in the spec `Operator maintained images lifecycle
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/rocky/approved/glance/operator-image-workflow.html>`_.

    Support in the glanceclient includes the following:

    - The following calls now allow the specification of a ``--hidden``
      option that takes a boolean value (``true`` or ``false``).  When
      this option is omitted, the default value is ``false``.

      * ``image-create``
      * ``image-create-via-import``
      * ``image-update``

    - The ``image-list`` call now allows the specification of a
      ``--hidden`` filter that takes a boolean value (``true`` or
      ``false``).  By default, "hidden" images are not displayed
      in the ``image-list`` response (that's why they're called
      "hidden").  To see those images, use ``--hidden true`` as a
      filter on the ``image-list`` call.
