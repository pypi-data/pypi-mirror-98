  This version of python-glanceclient finalizes client-side support for
  the Glance multiple stores feature.  See the `Multi Store Support
  <https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/admin/multistores.html>`_
  section of the Glance documentation for more information.

  Support for Glance multiple stores has been available on an EXPERIMENTAL
  basis since release 2.12.0.  For the Train release, the Image service
  has finalized how API users interact with multiple stores.  See the
  "Upgrade Notes" section of this document for information about changes this
  has necessitated in multistore support in the glanceclient.

    The following Command Line Interface calls now take a ``--store``
    option:

    * ``glance image-create``
    * ``glance image-create-via-import``
    * ``glance image-upload``
    * ``glance image-import``

    The value for this option is a store identifier.  The list of
    available stores may be obtained from the ``glance stores-info``
    command.

    The ``--backend`` option, available on some commands on an experimental
    basis since release 2.12.0, is no longer available.  Use ``--store``
    instead.
