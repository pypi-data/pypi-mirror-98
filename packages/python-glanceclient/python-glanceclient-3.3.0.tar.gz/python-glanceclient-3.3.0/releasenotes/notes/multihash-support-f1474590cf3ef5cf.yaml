    This release adds client support for the Glance "multihash" feature
    introduced in Rocky.  This feature introduces two new image properties,
    ``os_hash_algo`` and ``os_hash_value``.  The content of ``os_hash_algo``
    is an algorithm identifier recognized by the Python ``hashlib`` library.
    The ``os_hash_value`` is a hexdigest of the image data computed using
    this algorithm.  The ``os_hash_algo`` is not end-user settable; it
    is configured in Glance by the cloud operator.  In the glanceclient,
    the feature is limited solely to the display of these values.

    If the "multihash" properties are not available on an image, their
    values are displayed as ``None`` in the glanceclient image-show and
    image-list responses.
