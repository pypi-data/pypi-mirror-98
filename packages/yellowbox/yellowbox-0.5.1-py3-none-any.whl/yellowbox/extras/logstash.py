class FakeLogstashService(YellowService):
    """Implements a fake logging service that closely resembles Logstash.

    Accepts external TCP connections, with logs received in the "json_lines"
    format.

    Attributes:
        records: A list of all records received. You are welcome to modify,
        clear or iterate over this during runtime. New logs will be added in the
        order they were received. Each record is a dict - for possible keys see
        attribute docs.
        port: Dynamic port external service should connect to. FakeLogstashService
        automatically binds a free port during initialization unless chosen
        otherwise.
        local_host: Host to connect to from the local machine (=="localhost")
        container_host: Host to connect to from inside containers.
        encoding: Encoding of the json lines received. Defaults to utf-8 per
        specification.
        delimiter: Delimiter splitting between json objects. Defaults to b'\n'
        per specification.

    Example:
        >>> import socket
        >>> import time
        >>> ls = FakeLogstashService()
        >>> ls.start()
        >>> # Logstash Handler internally creates this connection and sends a log.
        >>> s = socket.create_connection((ls.local_host, ls.port))
        >>> s.sendall(b'{"record": "value", "level": "ERROR"}\\n')
        >>> s.close()
        >>> time.sleep(0.01)  # Wait for service to process message
        >>> ls.stop()
        >>> ls.assert_logs("ERROR")
        >>> assert ls.records[0]["record"] == "value"
