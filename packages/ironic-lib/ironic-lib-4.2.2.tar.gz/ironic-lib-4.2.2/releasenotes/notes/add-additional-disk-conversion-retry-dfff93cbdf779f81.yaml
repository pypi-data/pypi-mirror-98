    Adds an additional error to look for in the ``qemu-img`` image conversion
    retry logic to automatically retry if 'Cannot allocate memory' is
    encountered, as ``qemu-img`` makes a number of memory allocation requests
    and the most likely is upon creating the convesrsion thread resulting in
    'qemu: qemu_thread_create_: Resource temporarily unavailable'
    but other memory allocation fails can result in
    'Failed to allocate memory: Cannot allocate memory'. Both types of errors
    are now checked and automatically retried upon.
