    Implement Basic HTTP authentication middleware.

    This middleware is added to ironic-lib so that it can eventually be
    used by ironic and ironic-inspector as an alternative to noauth in
    standalone environments.

    This middleware is passed a path to a file which supports the
    Apache htpasswd syntax[1]. This file is read for every request, so no
    service restart is required when changes are made.

    The only password digest supported is bcrypt, and the ``bcrypt``
    python library is used for password checks since it supports ``$2y$``
    prefixed bcrypt passwords as generated by the Apache htpasswd utility.
