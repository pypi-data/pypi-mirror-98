    summary: Python programming language, version 3
    description: >-
        Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
        language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python includes
        modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types
        and dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and
        libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
        Mac and MFC).

        Programmers can write new built-in modules for Python in C or C++.
        Python can be used as an extension language for applications that
        need a programmable interface. â€™
