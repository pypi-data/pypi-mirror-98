```python
from pyrogis import Pierogi, SpatialQuantize, Sort, Threshold, Dish, Recipe
```

A processing factory, called an `Ingredient`,
has a `prep` method for receiving parameters,
and a `cook` method for operating
on a numpy array to produce a programmatic output.

These two methods are usually called implicitly,
`prep` on __init__ and `cook` obfuscated in the typical usage flow.
`prep` can be seen as parameterizing the manipulation
while `cook` applies it (to an array).

### pierogi

`Pierogi` is one of the simplest `Ingredient` types.
It stores pixels, usually loaded from an image.

`Pierogi` is unique in that the array it returns from its cook function
is not based on the input

```python
pierogi = Pierogi(file="/Users/kyle/Desktop/image.jpg")
pierogi = Pierogi(pixels=np.array(
    [[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], [[255, 255, 255], [255, 255, 255]]]
)
```

### quantize

`Quantize` is another `Ingredient`.
When cooked, it will process an incoming numpy array and return an array
where every pixel has been quantized to the closest color in the `palette`.

There is also the `SpatialQuantize` variant which is used for the cli tool.

```python
palette = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [127, 127, 127],
    [255, 255, 255]
]

quantize = Quantize(palette=palette)
quantized_pixels = quantize.cook(pierogi.pixels)
```

This should produce a pixel for pixel quantized version of the input array.

As you can see above, an `Pierogi` has a `pixels` member.
This is the internal numpy pixel array of that `Pierogi`
with shape `(width, height, 3)`.

Some other `Ingredient` types include: `Threshold`, `Flip`, and `Rotate`.

### recipe

A typical flow allows you to create a pipeline of `Ingredient` types
that sequentially apply their `cook` method on to
the previous array of pixels.

A pipeline in `pierogis` is called a `Recipe`. It is an `Ingredient` itself.

```python
recipe = Recipe(ingredients=[pierogi, quantize])
recipe.cook()

recipe = Recipe(ingredients=[quantize])
recipe.cook(pierogi.pixels)
```

The two will produce the same result. But there's a better way.

### dish

>*"get to the point already"*
>
>\- a wiser man

We could also use a `Dish` to serve this recipe.
This is the recommended way to use `Recipe`.

```python
dish = Dish(recipe=recipe, pierogis=[pierogi])
cooked_dish = dish.serve()
```

The recipe gets cooked sequentially for each pierogi in `pierogis`.
The output dish has `pierogis` member set with cooked pierogis.
The `save` method of `dish` can be used as well.

### seasoning

There is also a concept of seasonings.
They can be used to apply something like a mask
to other ingredients that affect the pixels they act on.

```python
sort = Sort()
seasoning = Threshold()

sort.season(seasoning)
```

`Threshold.cook` outputs a black and white array.
Now that `sort` is seasoned with the `Threshold`,
it will only sort pixels that have been "colored"
white by the `Threshold`

## extending

To create a custom `Ingredient` type,
it must subclass `Ingredient` and override the `cook` and `prep`
methods.

```python
class Custom(Ingredient):
    def prep(self, brighten: int, scale: int, **kwargs):
        self.brighten = brighten
        self.scale = scale
    def cook(self, pixels: np.ndarray):
        return (self.pixels + self.brighten) /*self.scale
```

### prep

*Override `prep` to parameterize your manipulation.*

This means any settings, constants,
or inputs that configure the new functionality.
Think about the `palette` used with
quantization.

```python
def prep(self, brighten: int, scale: int, *args, **kwargs):
    self.brighten = brighten
    self.scale = scale
```

### cook

*Override `cook` to perform the manipulation.*

This is the function that you acts on an input pixel grid.
More specifically, this function receives
a `(width, height, 3)` `ndarray`
and should return a 3d array that is also size 3 in the last dimension.

```python
def cook(self, pixels: np.ndarray):
    return (self.pixels + self.brighten) * self.scale
```

This function increases the r, g, and b of every pixel by `self.brighten`
then multiplies that sum for each by `self.scale`.

Numpy operations can be pretty fast if you can keep them vectorized.
This means try to avoid looping over the columns
and rows of an array.
