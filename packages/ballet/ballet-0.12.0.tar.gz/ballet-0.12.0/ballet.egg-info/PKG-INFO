        ## Overview
        
        Do you develop machine learning models? Do you work by yourself or on a team?
        Do you share notebooks or are you committing code to a shared repository? In
        contrast to successful, massively collaborative, open-source projects like
        the Linux kernel, the Rails framework, Firefox, GNU, or Tensorflow, most
        data science projects are developed by just a handful of people. But think if
        the open-source community could leverage its ingenuity and determination to
        collaboratively develop data science projects to predict the incidence of
        disease in a population, to predict whether vulnerable children will be evicted
        from their homes, or to predict whether learners will drop out of online
        courses.
        
        Our vision is to make collaborative data science possible by making it more
        like open-source software development. Our approach is based on decomposing the
        data science process into modular patches - standalone units of contribution -
        that can then be intelligently combined, representing objects like "feature",
        "labeling function", or "prediction task definition". Collaborators work in
        parallel to write patches and submit them to a repo. Our software framework
        provides the underlying functionality to merge high-quality contributions,
        collect modules from the file system, and compose the accepted contributions
        into a single product. It also provides a familiar notebook-based development
        experience that is friendly to data scientists and other inexperienced
        open-source contributors. We don't require any computing infrastructure beyond
        that which is commonly used in open-source software development.
        
        Currently, Ballet focuses on supporting collaboratively developing
        *feature engineering pipelines*, an important part of many data science
        projects. Individual features are represented as separate Python modules,
        declaring the subset of a dataframe that they operate on and a
        scikit-learn-style learned transformer that extracts feature values from the
        raw data. Ballet collects individual features and composes them into a
        feature engineering pipeline. At any point, a project built on Ballet can be
        installed for end-to-end feature engineering on new data instances for the
        same problem. How do we ensure the feature engineering pipeline is always
        useful? Ballet thoroughly validates proposed features for correctness and
        machine learning performance, using an extensive test suite and a novel
        streaming feature definition selection algorithm. Accepted features can be
        automatically merged by the ballet GitHub app into projects.
