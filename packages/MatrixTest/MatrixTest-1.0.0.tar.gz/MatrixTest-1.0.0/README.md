`MatrixTest` is a tool for matrix test where you have to run a cluster of similar shell commands.
When these commands have similar pattern, they are just combinations of different arguments (including argument 0, the executable itself).
Using `MatrixTest`, the only a few things you need to do are: configure, run, and output.
By providing a formatted command template string, all the possible arguments, and a function to parse the standard output, `MatrixTest` will handle the rest for you.
After that, just wait and find the results in the Excel.

# How to use

`MatrixTest` is a pure Python module so that you need to install and import it into your Python test script.

In the following How-tos, a toy script will be used as the executable.
It can accept any arguments and echo them out.
The source code is as simple as below:

```python
import sys

for item in sys.argv:
    print(item)
```

It can be executed with:

```shell
python cmd_example_program.py arg1 arg2 arg3    # You can add more
```

This will output:
```text
cmd_example_program.py      # argv[0]
arg1                        # argv[1]
arg2                        # argv[2]
arg3                        # argv[3]
```

## Install

```shell
pip install MatrixTest
```

Then you can import it in your script as:
```python
import MatrixTest
```

## Configure `MatrixTestRunner`

`MatrixTestRunner` is the main component of `MatrixTest` package.
You need to pass all the required information via its constructor:

```python
import MatrixTest
import random


def parser(stdout: str):
    lines = stdout.splitlines()
    result = {
        "lineCount": len(lines),
        "programName": lines[0],
        "random": random.randint(1, 10)
    }
    # return len(lines)
    return result


def main():
    cmd_template = "python E:\\MatrixTest\\cmd_example_program.py {arg1} {arg2} {arg3}"
    args = {
        "arg1": ["arg1_1", "arg1_2"],
        "arg2": ["arg2_1", "arg2_2", "arg2_3"],
        "arg3": ["arg3_1"]
    }
    mtr = MatrixTest.MatrixTestRunner(cmd_template, args, parser)
```

`cmd_template` is the command line template string.
`MatrixTest` uses Python's `string.format_map()` to generate generate executable command lines.
The template string includes mutable parts braced with `{key}` where the `key` is the name for that specific place and it will be replaced before actual execution.

`args` is a `dict` storing all possible values for all the keys. For example, 6 commands will be generated from the above configuration:
```text
python E:\MatrixTest\cmd_example_program.py arg1_1 arg2_1 arg3_1
python E:\MatrixTest\cmd_example_program.py arg1_1 arg2_2 arg3_1
python E:\MatrixTest\cmd_example_program.py arg1_1 arg2_3 arg3_1
python E:\MatrixTest\cmd_example_program.py arg1_2 arg2_1 arg3_1
python E:\MatrixTest\cmd_example_program.py arg1_2 arg2_2 arg3_1
python E:\MatrixTest\cmd_example_program.py arg1_2 arg2_3 arg3_1
```

`parser` is a parser function that takes textual `stdout` of each command and output parsed result(s). 
For example, you may want to get the numeric execution time from "Data processed in 2.333 seconds".
You can return a single or multiple result(s) from the parser function.
In the example above, we output multiple results in a dict.

Finally, just pass all three parameters into the `MatrixTestRunner` constructor and then it will check the parameters and do some initialization works.

## Run

To start testing, call the `run()` function with a integer indicating how many times you would like to execute repeatly:

```python
    mtr.run()                           # repeat once by default
    mtr.run(3)                          # repeat three times
```

## Aggregate (statistics result)

After getting the raw data, you may calculate the aggregated results from it. Take arithmetic mean as the example here:

```python
    mtr.average(["random", "lineCount"])        # only calculate mean for designated keys, 
                                                # remember we return these from the parser function
    mtr.average()                               # calculate mean for all keys
```

For now, we support the following aggregation operators:

* average (arithmetic mean)

## Access the results

We use `pandas.DataFrame` to store all the results for the current run.
Both raw data and aggregated data are stored in a single DataFrame.

### Data layout

The structure of the result table is like below:

| cmd_full                                                         | arg1   | arg2   | arg3   | attempt1_lineCount | attempt1_programName                 | attempt1_random | attempt2_lineCount | ... | avg_random | avg_lineCount |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----|------------|---------------|
| python E:\MatrixTest\cmd_example_program.py arg1_1 arg2_1 arg3_1 | arg1_1 | arg2_1 | arg3_1 | 4                  | E:\MatrixTest\cmd_example_program.py | 6               | 4                  |     | 3          | 4             |
| ...                                                              |        |        |        |                    |                                      |                 |                    |     |            |               |

The table starts with the full command and arguments, followed by results for every attempt.
The columns are named after `attempt<No.repeat>_<key from parser>`.
Finally, aggregated results in those `avg_<key from parser & params of average()>` columns.

Data types are inferred by `pandas`.

### Access the internal data structure

You can directly access the `DataFrame` by calling `mtr.get_last_result()`.

### Output to Excel

Generally, we recommend you to output your data to an Excel spreadsheet for further inspection.

```python
    mtr.to_excel("E:\\MatrixTest\\example_output.xlsx", include_agg=True, include_raw=True)
```

The first parameter is the output file path. Also, you can choose whether include raw/aggregated data in the Excel or not via the last two parameters.
