Description: Async Cmd2
        ==========
        
        Async extension to a famous
        `Cmd2 <https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2>`__ library.
        
        Cmd2 permanently occupies the main thread which is a problem if you plan
        to receive callbacks on the main thread (e.g., by Bluetooth stack Bleak)
        
        Pip installation
        ----------------
        
        BoolTest is available via ``pip``:
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install ph4-acmd2
        
        Local installation
        ------------------
        
        From the local dir:
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install --upgrade --find-links=. .
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import asyncio
            import ph4acmd2
        
            class CmdLineApp(ph4acmd2.Cmd):
                async def main(self):
                    await self.acmdloop()
                    print("Cmdloop finished now")
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                app = CmdLineApp()
                loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
                loop.set_debug(True)
                loop.run_until_complete(app.main())
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        We use
        `asyncio.lool.add\_reader <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.add_reader>`__
        to read from the stdin and process the commands thus it is not currently
        possible to ue readline features such as auto-complete or ctrl-r,
        UP-arrow for previous commands, etc...
        
        Readline occupies main thread in a blocking way, so it is not compatible
        with runloop model running on the main thread and executing coroutines.
        
        In order to use readline it needs to add async support. A potential
        workaround could be to access terminal in async way e.g., submit short
        coroutine monitoring the terminal state to simulate readline library.
        However, it is not tested.
