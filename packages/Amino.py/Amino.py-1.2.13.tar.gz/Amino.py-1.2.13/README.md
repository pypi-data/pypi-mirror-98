A library to create Amino bots.

### API Reference
Read the Docs: [Link Here](https://aminopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

#### What is this?
Amino.py is a python api for communicating with amino servers while pretending that you are an app user. This is mostly accomplished by spoofing device configuration headers, though actually generating those is still in progress. It is also for objectifying and organizing amino response data, so that actually doing anything is easier.

#### How do I use this?
You'll need Python 3 to use it, I recommend using Python 3.6 or earlier to use the library.
To install it just open the command line and type out this command `python3 -m pip install Amino.py`
