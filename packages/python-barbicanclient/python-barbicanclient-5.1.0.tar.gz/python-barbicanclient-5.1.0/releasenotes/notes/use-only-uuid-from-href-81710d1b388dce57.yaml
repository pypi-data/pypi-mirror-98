    Lookups (for all Read/Update/Delete actions) are now performed using only
    the UUID of the entity. For backward compatability, full HATEOS refs may
    be used, but everything before the UUID will be stripped and the service
    catalog entry for Barbican will be substituted. This should have no impact
    on accessing existing secrets with any version of Barbican.
