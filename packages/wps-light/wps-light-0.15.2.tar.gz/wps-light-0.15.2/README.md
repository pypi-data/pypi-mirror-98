*wemake-python-styleguide*, but lighter.

This project is simply a fork of
[wemake-python-styleguide](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide),
**without these flake8 plugins dependencies**:

- flake8-commas
- flake8-quotes
- flake8-comprehensions
- flake8-docstrings
- flake8-string-format
- flake8-bugbear 
- flake8-debugger
- flake8-isort
- flake8-eradicate
- flake8-bandit
- flake8-broken-line
- flake8-rst-docstrings
- pep8-naming
- darglint

It can still be installed and used as a flake8 plugin.

Please refer to [wemake-python-styleguide's documentation](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/).
