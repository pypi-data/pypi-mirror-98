About Sushy CLI
===============

Sushy CLI tool is intended to help human beings to communicate with `Redfish`_
based baseboard management controllers (BMC).

BMCs offer powerful means of controlling bare metal machines. For example, one
can flip machine power, change BIOS configuration or even flash the firmware.

The `sushycli` tool offers a friendly command-line interface to some of the BMC
features. It's main audience include software developers working on bare metal
management automation and system administrators handling the raw iron with bare
hands.
