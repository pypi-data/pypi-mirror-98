class Server:
    """
    Manages a Comsol server instance.

    Instances of this class start and eventually stop Comsol servers
    running on the local machine. Clients, either running on the same
    machine or elsewhere on the network, can then connect to the
    server at the port it exposes for that purpose.

    Example:
    ```python
        import mph
        server = mph.Server(cores=1)
        print(f'Server listing on port {server.port}.')
        server.stop()
    ```

    For this to work, make sure the Comsol server was started at least
    once from the command line, so that you have had a chance to define
    a user name and password.

    For client―server connections across the network, the server's
    host name or IP address has to be known up front by the client. It
    has to be either hard-coded or managed otherwise. Though if client
    and server run on the same machine, it is simply `"localhost"`.
    (However, *in* that situation, you may be better served — pardon
    the pun — to simply run a stand-alone client.)

    The first server starting on a given computer will typically accept
    client connections on TCP communication port 2036, as per Comsol's
    default configuration. Servers started subsequently will use port
    numbers of increasing value. The actual port number of a server
    instance can be accessed via its `port` attribute after it has
    started.

    The number of processor `cores` the server makes use of may be
    restricted. If no number is given, all cores are used by default.

    A specific `version` of the Comsol back-end can be specified if
    several are installed on the machine, for example `version='5.3a'`.
    Otherwise the latest version is used.

    A `timeout` can be set for the server to start up. The default
    is 60 seconds. Raises `TimeoutError` if the server failed to start
    within that period. Raises `RuntimeError` if user name and password
    for the server have not been set by the user.
