AcraNetwork [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diarmuidcwc/AcraNetwork.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diarmuidcwc/AcraNetwork)[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/diarmuidcwc/AcraNetwork/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/diarmuidcwc/AcraNetwork)
===========

A collection of classes that can be used to decom network or PCM based FTI traffic

#Summary

* iNetX : Class for packing and unpacking iNetX objects
* IENA  : Class for packing and unpacking IENA objects
* SimpleEthernet : A  simplified set of classes for Ethernet, IP and UDP packets. These are not fully featured is
sufficient for the network systems used in the KAM500 networks
* Pcap : Class and helper methods for reading pcap files
* McastSocket : Class to bind to ports to capture multicast packets

#Install
Install using the standard setuptools install method
```shell
python setup.py install
```
or clone this repository to your local directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/diarmuidcwc/AcraNetwork.git
```

#Usage
Here are two brief examples on how to create and read a pcap file. Further examples can be viewed in the examples
directory or in the unittest folder

To read in a pcap file with multiple ethernet packets all containing an iNetX packet wrapped in UDP

```python
import sys
#sys.path.append("..")

import AcraNetwork.iNetX as inetx
import AcraNetwork.SimpleEthernet as SimpleEthernet
import AcraNetwork.Pcap as pcap

import struct
mypcap = pcap.Pcap("inetx_test.pcap")       # Read the pcap file
for mypcaprecord in mypcap:

	ethpacket = SimpleEthernet.Ethernet()   # Create an Ethernet object
	ethpacket.unpack(mypcaprecord.packet)   # Unpack the pcap record into the eth object
	ippacket =  SimpleEthernet.IP()         # Create an IP packet
	ippacket.unpack(ethpacket.payload)      # Unpack the ethernet payload into the IP packet
	udppacket = SimpleEthernet.UDP()        # Create a UDP packet
	udppacket.unpack(ippacket.payload)      # Unpack the IP payload into the UDP packet
	inetxpacket = inetx.iNetX()             # Create an iNetx object
	inetxpacket.unpack(udppacket.payload)   # Unpack the UDP payload into this iNetX object
	print("INETX: StreamID ={:08X} Sequence = {:8d} PTP Seconds = {}".format(inetxpacket.streamid,inetxpacket.sequence,inetxpacket.ptptimeseconds))
```
