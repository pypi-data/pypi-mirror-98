# in turn override the values here.

# The keys may have either underscores '_' or dashes '-' separating
# words. In either case, the command line options is
# '--<key with dashes>' and the variable name inside SEAMM is
# '<key with underscores>', e.g. 'log_level' or 'log-level' are
# identical in this file. The command line key would be '--log-level'
# and the variable in SEAMM 'log_level'.
#
# The file is broken into sections, with a name in square brackets,
# like [lammps-step]. Within each section there can be a series of
# option = value statements. ';' or '#' introduce comment lines. The
# section names are case-sensitive but variables within sections are
# not.
#
# Two sections are special: [DEFAULT] and [global]. All other sections
# correspond to plug-ins in SEAMM, and generally have the form
# [xxxxx-step], in lowercase.
#
# [DEFAULT] provides default values for any other section. If an
# option is requested for a section, but does not exist in that
# section, the option is looked for in the [DEFAULT] section. If it
# exists there, the corresponding value is used.
#
# Finally, options can refer to options in the same or other sections
# with a syntax like ${section:option}. If the section is omitted, it
# looks in the current section and [DEFAULTS], in that
# order. Otherwise it looks in the given section and [DEFAULTS].
#
# The [SEAMM] section contains options for the SEAMM environment
# itself. On the command line these come before any options for
# plug-ins, which follow the name of the plug-in, which is the section
# in this file.
