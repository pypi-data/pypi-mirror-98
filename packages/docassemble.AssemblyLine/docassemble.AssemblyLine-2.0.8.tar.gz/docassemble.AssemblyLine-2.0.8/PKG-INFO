Description: # Document Assembly Line - Runtime Code
        
        A jurisdiction-agnostic runtime package that supports rapidly automating forms
        with a controlled style. Saves time over using just the base docassemble
        platform.
        
        This is the run-time code that supports the interviews at https://courtformsonline.org
        
        This package supersedes [MAVirtualCourt](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-MAVirtualCourt).
        
        # Migration
        
        * Remove any references to MAVirtualCourt. Add an include block like this at the top
          of your interview YAML file
        
        ```
        include:
          - docassemble.AssemblyLine:al_package.yml
          - docassemble.MassAccess:massaccess.yml
        ```
        
        * Change references to `basic_questions_intro_screen` to `al_intro_screen`
