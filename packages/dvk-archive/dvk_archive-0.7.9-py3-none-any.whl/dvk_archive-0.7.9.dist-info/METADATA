## Reformatting

Scripts for editing DVK files and their referenced media.

### dvk-rename

    dvk_rename [directory]

# DVK File Format

DVK files are simply repackaged JSON files that contain useful metadata fields for media files downloaded from the internet.
DVK files contain only metadata, and point to separate media files (images, video, audio, etc.).

Below are the standard DVK metadata fields, shown with their corresponding JSON keys.

### id

(str)
A unique ID for other DVK files to reference.

### title

(String)
The title for the referenced media.

### artists

(list[str])
A list of artists/authors who created the referenced media.

### time

(str)
A string showing the time and date in which the referenced media was published/uploaded.

Formatted YYYY/MM/DD|hh:mm

Example: 6 October, 2017 @ 5:00PM -> 2017/10/06|17:00

### web_tags

(list[str])
A list of tags gathered from the referenced media's original web source.

### description

(str)
A media description gathered from the referenced media's original web source.

### page_url

(str)
The URL of the web page from which the referenced media was sourced.

### direct_url

(str)
The direct media URL from which the referenced media was downloaded.
Not to be confused with the page_url, which is the URL for the page containing both the referenced media and accessory info.

### secondary_url

(str)
The direct media URL from which the secondary media file was downloaded.
This field is only used if the DVK references a secondary media file. (See [secondary file](#secondary_file))

### media_file

(str)
File path of the referenced media file.
Path is relative to the directory of the DVK file.

### secondary_file

(str)
File path of a secondary media file that supplements the main media file.
For example, a DVK that references a text file might have a secondary file for the cover illustration.
Path is relative to the directory of the DVK file.
Not used if there is no secondary media file.

### favorites

(list[str])
A list of artists who favorited the media on the site it originated from.
Used to indicate that the media was downloaded from a favorites gallery and not from the artist themselves.

### is_single
(bool)
Whether the file was downloaded on its own rather than as part of a larger gallery.
