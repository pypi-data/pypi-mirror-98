    The ``python-openstackclient`` package is no longer a requirement
    for ``python-ironic-inspector-client`` to be installed. If you wish
    to use the **ironic-inspector** cli, you should install
    ``python-openstackclient`` manually or use setuptools "extra" option
    to install both packages automatically::

         pip install python-ironic-inspector-client[cli]
