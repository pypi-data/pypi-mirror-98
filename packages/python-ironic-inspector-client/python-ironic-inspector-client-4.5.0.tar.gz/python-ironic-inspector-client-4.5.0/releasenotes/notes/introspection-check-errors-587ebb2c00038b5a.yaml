    Adds ``--check-errors`` flag to verify if any error occurred when
    waiting for the introspection to finish for the selected nodes.
    If any error occurs no output is displayed and the exit status for the
    command is different from 0 (success).
    The ``--check-errors`` option can only be used with ``--wait``.
