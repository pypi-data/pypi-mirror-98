upgrade:
  - |
    There is no longer a default introspection API endpoint. Previously,
    if no endpoint was requested and no endpoint found in the service catalog,
    ``127.0.0.1:5050`` was used by default.
other:
  - |
    The ``ClientV1`` constructor now raises a new ``EndpointNotFound``
    exception when no introspection API endpoint can be detected. Previously
    this condition was ignored and ``127.0.0.1:5050`` was used as a fallback.
