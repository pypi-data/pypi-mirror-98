'''
This module defines classes to handle files in distributed environments
where filesyatems may not be shared.

Objects of each class are instantiated with the path of an existing file on
an existing file syatem:

    fh = FileHandle('/path/to/file')

and have a save() method that creates a local copy of that file:

    filename_here = fh.save(filename_here)

they inherit from os.PathLike so can be used anywhere a conventional path can
be used:

    with open(fh) as f:
        ...
