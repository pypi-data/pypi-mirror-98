Description: # screenselector
        
        A small utility that allows selecting from running screen sessions by menu.
        
        # Purpose
        
        It happened several times to me that I closed a terminal window by accident or that
        I lost something when my Xorg crashed.
        
        So my Idea was to start a new screen session instead of a plain shell in my terminal.
        
        This tool will now present me a list of unattached and attached screen sessions
        and allow me to attach to them.
        
        # Usage
        
        I change the command to be invoked in my terminal emulator to be screenselector,
        so whenever I open a new terminal, I can start a new screen session or reconnect
        to an already running.
        
        # Platform
        
        Tested with debian and gnome-terminal and others.
        
        # Bugs
        
        Screen sessions that contain a whitespace it their name are not displayed.
