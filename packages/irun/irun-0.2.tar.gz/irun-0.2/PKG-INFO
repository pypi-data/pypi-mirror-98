Description: # IRUN: Indulgent Reiz User Notation
        
        A human-friendly query language (python-like DSL) for generating
        [Reiz QL](https://github.com/reizio/reiz.io/blob/master/docs/reizql.md) queries.
        
        ## Example
        
        ```py
        with open(...) as $stream:
            tree = ast.parse($stream.read())
        ```
        
        The query above would match all of these potential cases (via [Reiz](https://github.com/reizio/reiz.io)):
        ```py
        with open('somefile.py') as file_s:
            tree = ast.parse(file_s.read())
        
        with open(some_path) as stream:
            tree = ast.parse(stream.read())
        
        with open(pathlib_path / 'file.py') as s_file:
            tree = ast.parse(s_file.read())
        ```
        
        and filter out the rest (stuff like this):
        ```py
        with open(pathlib_path / 'file.py', encoding='x') as stream:
            tree = ast.parse(stream.read())
        
        with open() as stream:
            tree = ast.parse(stream.read())
        
        with foo(path) as stream:
            tree = ast.parse(stream.read())
        
        with open(path) as stream:
            tree = ast.parse(other_stream.read())
        
        with open(path) as stream:
            tree = ast.foo(stream.read())
        
        with open(path) as stream:
            tree = bar.parse(stream.read())
        
        with open(path) as stream:
            tree = bar.baz(stream.read())
        
        with open(path) as xxx:
            tree = ast.parse(yyy.read())
        
        with open(path) as xxx:
            zzz = ast.parse(xxx.read())
        ```
