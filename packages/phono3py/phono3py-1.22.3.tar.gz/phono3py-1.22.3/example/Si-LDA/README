This is the example of silicon calculation. The supercell is 2x2x2 of the conventinal unit cell. The VASP calculation was made for force calculations with 300 eV, 2x2x2 off-Gamma-centre k-point sampling mesh for the supercell, and LDA. Silicon crystal is F-centre, so there is the transformation matrix from the conventinal unit cell to the primitive cell.

To create fc3.hdf5 and fc2.hdf5,

% phono3py --dim="2 2 2" --sym-fc -c POSCAR-unitcell

Using 11x11x11 sampling mesh, lattice thermal conductivity is calculated by

% phono3py --dim="2 2 2" --pa="0 1/2 1/2 1/2 0 1/2 1/2 1/2 0" -c POSCAR-unitcell --mesh="11 11 11" --fc3 --fc2 --br

kappa-m111111.hdf5 is written as the result. The lattice thermal conductivity is calculated as 112.5 W/m-K at 300 K. This becomes, with 19x19x19 sampling mesh, 127.0 W/m-K.

Accumulated lattice thermal conductivity is calculated using 'phono3py-kaccum' script.

% phono3py-kaccum --mesh="11 11 11" --pa="0 1/2 1/2 1/2 0 1/2 1/2 1/2 0" POSCAR-unitcell kappa-m111111.hdf5 |tee kaccum.dat


The file 'vasprun_xmls.tar.lzma' in this example contains vasprun.xml's that are used to generate FORCES_FC3. To test the FORCES_FC3 generation, after decompressing this file, the following command is executed at current directory:

% phono3py --cf3 vasprun_xmls/disp-{00001..00111}/vasprun.xml
