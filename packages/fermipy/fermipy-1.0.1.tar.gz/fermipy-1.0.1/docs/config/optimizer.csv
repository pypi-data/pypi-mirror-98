``init_lambda``	0.0001	Initial value of damping parameter for step size calculation when using the NEWTON fitter.  A value of zero disables damping.
``max_iter``	100	Maximum number of iterations for the Newtons method fitter.
``min_fit_quality``	2	Set the minimum fit quality.
``optimizer``	MINUIT	Set the optimization algorithm to use when maximizing the likelihood function.
``retries``	3	Set the number of times to retry the fit when the fit quality is less than ``min_fit_quality``.
``tol``	0.001	Set the optimizer tolerance.
``verbosity``	0
