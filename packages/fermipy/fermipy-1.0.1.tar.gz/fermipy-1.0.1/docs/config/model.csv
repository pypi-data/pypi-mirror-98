``assoc_xmatch_columns``	['3FGL_Name']	Choose a set of association columns on which to cross-match catalogs.
``catalogs``	None	
``diffuse``	None	
``diffuse_dir``	None	
``diffuse_xml``	None	
``extdir``	None	Set a directory that will be searched for extended source FITS templates.  Template files in this directory will take precendence over catalog source templates with the same name.
``extract_diffuse``	False	Extract a copy of all mapcube components centered on the ROI.
``galdiff``	None	Set the path to one or more galactic IEM mapcubes.  A separate component will be generated for each item in this list.
``isodiff``	None	Set the path to one or more isotropic templates.  A separate component will be generated for each item in this list.
``limbdiff``	None	
``merge_sources``	True	Merge properties of sources that appear in multiple source catalogs.  If merge_sources=false then subsequent sources with the same name will be ignored.
``sources``	None	
``src_radius``	None	Radius of circular region in degrees centered on the ROI that selects sources for inclusion in the model.  If this parameter is none then no selection is applied.  This selection is ORed with the ``src_roiwidth`` selection.
``src_radius_roi``	None	Half-width of ``src_roiwidth`` selection.  This parameter can be used in lieu of ``src_roiwidth``.
``src_roiwidth``	None	Width of square region in degrees centered on the ROI that selects sources for inclusion in the model.  If this parameter is none then no selection is applied.  This selection will be ORed with the ``src_radius`` selection.
