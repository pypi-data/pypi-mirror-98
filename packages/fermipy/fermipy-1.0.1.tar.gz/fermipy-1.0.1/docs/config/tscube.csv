``cov_scale``	-1.0	Scale factor to apply to broadband fitting cov. matrix in bin-by-bin fits ( < 0 -> fixed ) 
``cov_scale_bb``	-1.0	Scale factor to apply to global fitting cov. matrix in broadband fits. ( < 0 -> no prior ) 
``do_sed``	True	Compute the energy bin-by-bin fits
``exclude``	None	List of sources that will be removed from the model when computing the TS map.
``init_lambda``	0	Initial value of damping parameter for newton step size calculation.   A value of zero disables damping.
``max_iter``	30	Maximum number of iterations for the Newtons method fitter.
``model``	None	Dictionary defining the spatial/spectral properties of the test source. If model is None the test source will be a PointSource with an Index 2 power-law spectrum.
``nnorm``	10	Number of points in the likelihood v. normalization scan
``norm_sigma``	5.0	Number of sigma to use for the scan range 
``remake_test_source``	False	If true, recomputes the test source image (otherwise just shifts it)
``st_scan_level``	0	Level to which to do ST-based fitting (for testing)
``tol``	0.001	Critetia for fit convergence (estimated vertical distance to min < tol )
``tol_type``	0	Absoulte (0) or relative (1) criteria for convergence.
