``free_params``	None	
``max_iter``	5	Maximum number of source finding iterations.  The source finder will continue adding sources until no additional peaks are found or the number of iterations exceeds this number.
``min_separation``	1.0	Minimum separation in degrees between sources detected in each iteration. The source finder will look for the maximum peak in the TS map within a circular region of this radius.
``model``	None	Dictionary defining the spatial/spectral properties of the test source. If model is None the test source will be a PointSource with an Index 2 power-law spectrum.
``multithread``	False	Split the calculation across number of processes set by nthread option.
``nthread``	None	Number of processes to create when multithread is True.  If None then one process will be created for each available core.
``sources_per_iter``	4	Maximum number of sources that will be added in each iteration.  If the number of detected peaks in a given iteration is larger than this number, only the N peaks with the largest TS will be used as seeds for the current iteration.
``sqrt_ts_threshold``	5.0	Source threshold in sqrt(TS).  Only peaks with sqrt(TS) exceeding this threshold will be used as seeds for new sources.
``tsmap_fitter``	tsmap	Set the method for generating the TS map.  Valid options are tsmap or tscube.
