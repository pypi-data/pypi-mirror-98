``fix_shape``	False	Fix spectral shape parameters of the source of interest. If True then only the normalization parameter will be fit.
``free_background``	False	Leave background parameters free when performing the fit. If True then any parameters that are currently free in the model will be fit simultaneously with the source of interest.
``free_radius``	None	Free normalizations of background sources within this angular distance in degrees from the source of interest.  If None then no sources will be freed.
``loge_bounds``	None	Restrict the analysis to an energy range (emin,emax) in log10(E/MeV) that is a subset of the analysis energy range. By default the full analysis energy range will be used.  If either emin/emax are None then only an upper/lower bound on the energy range wil be applied.
``make_plots``	False	Generate diagnostic plots.
``model``	None	Dictionary defining the spatial/spectral properties of the test source. If model is None the test source will be a PointSource with an Index 2 power-law spectrum.
``multithread``	False	Split the calculation across number of processes set by nthread option.
``nthread``	None	Number of processes to create when multithread is True.  If None then one process will be created for each available core.
``use_weights``	False	Used weighted version of maps in making plots.
``write_fits``	True	Write the output to a FITS file.
``write_npy``	True	Write the output dictionary to a numpy file.
