        ## Introduction
        
        EyesLibraryExtended is a Robot Framework Library to automate visual software testing verification. EyesLibraryExtended uses a Python SDK called [Eyes-Selenium](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eyes-selenium) from the tool [Applitools Eyes](http://applitools.com/), and can be used with the [SeleniumLibrary](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary) and/or the [AppiumLibrary](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) .
        
        This library is a fork of EyesLibrary (https://github.com/joel-oliveira/EyesLibrary) which again is a fork of [Robot-AppEyes](https://github.com/NaviNet/Robot-AppEyes).
        
        In order to use EyesLibraryExtended, you are required to [sign up](https://applitools.com/sign-up/) for a free account with Applitools. See the [Usage](https://github.com/JisThomas14/EyesLibraryExtended#usage) section.
        
        - Information about EyesLibraryExtended keywords can be found on the [Keyword Documentation](https://jisthomas14.github.io/EyesLibraryExtended/) page.
        
        - The [Applitools Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/eyes-selenium/) may be consulted in order to understand how Eyes works.
        
        - More information about the SeleniumLibrary can be found on the [SeleniumLibrary Repo](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary) and in the [Keyword Documentation](http://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html).
        
        - More information about the AppiumLibrary can be found on the [AppiumLibrary Repo](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) and in the [Keyword Documentation](http://serhatbolsu.github.io/robotframework-appiumlibrary/AppiumLibrary.html).
        
        ## Requirements
        
        The following versions were used to test the library:
        
        - Python 2.7.14 or 3.7.0
        - Robot Framework 3.1.1
        - Eyes-Selenium 4.17.1
        - SeleniumLibrary 3.3.1 (For Web Tests)
        - AppiumLibrary 1.5.0.3 (For Mobile Tests)
        
        ## Installation
        
        The recommended **installation** method is using [pip](http://pip-installer.org):
        
            pip install robotframework-eyeslibraryextended
        
        To **update** both the library and all
        its dependencies to the latest version:
        
            pip install --upgrade robotframework-eyeslibraryextended
        
        To install a **specific version**:
        
            pip install robotframework-eyeslibraryextended==(DesiredVersion)
        
        #### Uninstall
        
        To uninstall EyesLibraryExtended use the following pip command:
        
            pip uninstall robotframework-eyeslibraryextended

        ## Usage
        
        You must create a [free account](https://applitools.com/sign-up/) with Applitools in order to run
        EyesLibraryExtended and return results.
        
        Then, to use the library, follow [EyesLibraryExtended Keyword Documentation](https://jisthomas14.github.io/EyesLibraryExtended/).
        
        This is a Robot Framework library. If you're not familiarized with Robot Framework, 
        please consult [Robot Framework User Guide](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/UserGuide).
        
        ## Running the Demo
        
        At _tests/acceptance_ directory, you can find Robot Framework tests for:
        
        - Web
        - Android Browser
        - Android Native App
        - Android Hybrid App
        - iOS Browser
        - iOS Native App
        - iOS Hybrid App
        
        Before running the tests, your Applitools API Key must be set in _tests/acceptance/resources/common.robot_, by replacing "YourApplitoolsApiKey" with your own key.
        
        When running the mobile tests, you must replace the variables within _tests/acceptance/resources/mobile.robot_ with your own, as well as the ones in _tests/acceptance/resources/android.robot_ or _tests/acceptance/resources/ios.robot_, according to the OS in use.
        
        For instance, you may want to use a different Remote URL than the one provided in the variables. So, if you are working with [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com/), for example, you'd have to replace the Remote URL variable in _tests/acceptance/resources/mobile.robot_:
        
            ${REMOTE URL}          http://${CREDENTIALS}@hub.testingbot.com/wd/hub
        
        Before running the Android Hybrid App tests, you need to install the Demo App (APK found at _tests/resources_) in your device.
        
        For in depth detail on how the keywords function, read the Keyword documentation found here: [Keyword Documentation](https://jisthomas14.github.io/EyesLibraryExtended/)
        
        **Remember to include your Applitools API key otherwise the
        test will not run.** To run a test, open a command prompt within the _tests/acceptance_ folder and run:
        
            robot FILENAME.robot
        
        For example, to run the Test Suite for Web:
        
            robot web.robot
        
        **Note:** It is assumed that anyone who wants to use this demo is already able to execute robot tests using SeleniumLibrary (for web tests) and/or AppiumLibrary (for mobile tests). The browser used to navigate with SeleniumLibrary is Google Chrome.
        
        ## Things to Note When Using Applitools
        
        - The tests will be accepted automatically by Applitools Eyes after the first run because a new baseline is being created. A second test run will show a comparison between screens.
        - Changing the Applitools baseline parameters will create a new baseline, that is automatically accepted on the first run. (For more information, read the article: [What is a ‘baseline’ and how is a baseline created?](https://help.applitools.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007188691-What-is-a-baseline-and-how-is-a-baseline-created-)
        - The viewport size should not be set to greater values than the maximum size of the device's window.
        (For more information on using viewports, consult [Using viewports in Eyes](https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/using-viewports-in-eyes.html))
        
        ## Getting Help
        
        To be defined. It might be helpful to read [Applitools Documentation](https://applitools.com/docs).

        EyesLibraryExtended was forked from EyesLibrary (https://github.com/joel-oliveira/EyesLibrary) on version 2.1 ,which again is a fork of [Robot-AppEyes](https://github.com/NaviNet/Robot-AppEyes) on version 1.2.
