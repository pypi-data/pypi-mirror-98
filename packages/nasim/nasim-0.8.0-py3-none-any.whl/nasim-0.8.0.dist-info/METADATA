Network Attack Simulator
========================

|docs|

Network Attack Simulator (NASim) is a simulated computer network complete with vulnerabilities, scans and exploits designed to be used as a testing environment for AI agents and planning techniques applied to network penetration testing.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install the latest version of NASim hosted on PyPi is via pip::

  $ pip install nasim


To install dependencies for running the DQN test agent (this is needed to run the demo) run::

  $ pip install nasim[dqn]


To get the latest bleeding edge version and install in development mode see the `Install docs <https://networkattacksimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/installation.html>`_


Demo
----

To see NASim in action, you can run the provided demo to interact with an environment directly or see a pre-trained AI agent in action.

To run the `tiny` benchmark scenario demo in interactive mode run::

  $ python -m nasim.demo tiny


This will then run an interactive console where the user can see the current state and choose the next action to take. The goal of the scenario is to *compromise* every host with a non-zero value.

See `here <https://networkattacksimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/scenarios/benchmark_scenarios.html>`_ for the full list of scenarios.

To run the `tiny` benchmark scenario demo using the pre-trained AI agent, first ensure the DQN dependencies are installed (see *Installation* section above), then run::

  $ python -m nasim.demo tiny -ai


**Note:** Currently you can only run the AI demo for the `tiny` scenario.


Documentation
-------------

The documentation is available at: https://networkattacksimulator.readthedocs.io/



Using with OpenAI gym
---------------------

NASim implements the `Open AI Gym <https://github.com/openai/gym>`_ environment interface and so can be used with any algorithm that is developed for that interface.

See `Starting NASim using OpenAI gym <https://networkattacksimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/gym_load.html>`_.

What's new
----------

- 2021-3-15 (v 0.8.0) (MINOR release)

  + Added option of specifying a 'value' for each host when defining a custom network using the .YAML format (thanks @Joe-zsc for the suggestion).
  + Added the 'small-honeypot' scenario to included scenarios.

- 2020-12-24 (v 0.7.5) (MICRO release)

  + Added 'undefined error' to observation to fix issue with initial and later observations being indistinguishable.

- 2020-12-17 (v 0.7.4) (MICRO release)

  + Fixed issues with incorrect observation of host 'value' and 'discovery_value'. Now, when in partially observable mode, the agent will correctly only observe these values on the step that they are recieved.
  + Some other minor code formatting fixes

- 2020-09-23 (v 0.7.3) (MICRO release)

  + Fixed issue with scenario YAML files not being included with PyPi package
  + Added final policy visualisation option to DQN and Q-Learning agents

- 2020-09-20 (v 0.7.2) (MICRO release)

  + Fixed bug with 're-registering' Gym environments when reloading modules
  + Added example implementations of Tabular Q-Learning: `agents/ql_agent.py` and `agents/ql_replay.py`
  + Added `Agents` section to docs, along with other minor doc updates

- 2020-09-20 (v 0.7.1) (MICRO release)

  + Added some scripts for running random benchmarks and describing benchmark scenarios
  + Added some more docs (including for creating custom scenarios) and updated other docs

- 2020-09-20 (v 0.7.0) (MINOR release)

  + Implemented host based firewalls
  + Added priviledge escalation
  + Added a demo script, including a pre-trained agent for the 'tiny' scenario
  + Fix to upper bound calculation (factored in reward for discovering a host)

- 2020-08-02 (v 0.6.0) (MINOR release)

  + Implemented compatibility with gym.make()
  + Updated docs for loading and interactive with NASimEnv
  + Added extra functions to nasim.scenarios to make it easier to load scenarios seperately to a NASimEnv
  + Fixed bug to do with class attributes and creating different scenarios in same python session
  + Fixed up bruteforce agent and tests

- 2020-07-31 (v 0.5.0) (MINOR release)

  + First official release on PyPi
  + Cleaned up dependencies, setup.py, etc and some small fixes
