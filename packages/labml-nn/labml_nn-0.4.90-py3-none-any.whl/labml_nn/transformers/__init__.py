# Transformers

This module contains [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
implementations and explanations of original transformer
from paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762),
and derivatives and enhancements of it.

* [Multi-head attention](mha.html)
* [Transformer Encoder and Decoder Models](models.html)
* [Fixed positional encoding](positional_encoding.html)

## [Transformer XL](xl/index.html)
This implements Transformer XL model using
[relative multi-head attention](xl/relative_mha.html)

## [Compressive Transformer](compressive/index.html)

This is an implementation of compressive transformer
that extends upon [Transformer XL](xl/index.html) by compressing
oldest memories to give a longer attention span.

## [GPT Architecture](gpt)

This is an implementation of GPT-2 architecture.

## [GLU Variants](glu_variants/simple.html)

This is an implementation of the paper
[GLU Variants Improve Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202).

## [kNN-LM](knn)

This is an implementation of the paper
[Generalization through Memorization: Nearest Neighbor Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00172).

## [Feedback Transformer](feedback)

This is an implementation of the paper
[Accessing Higher-level Representations in Sequential Transformers with Feedback Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09402).

## [Switch Transformer](switch)

This is a miniature implementation of the paper
[Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961).
Our implementation only has a few million parameters and doesn't do model parallel distributed training.
It does single GPU training but we implement the concept of switching as described in the paper.
