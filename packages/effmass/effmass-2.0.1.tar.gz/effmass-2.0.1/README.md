üíÉ Effmass now has a command line interface  
üíÉ Effmass now supports FHI-Aims, Castep and ASE  
‚ö†Ô∏è The `Data` class has now been renamed `DataVasp`. You may need to update your scripts!

`effmass` is a [peer-reviewed](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00797) Python (3.6+) package for calculating various definitions of effective mass from the electronic bandstructure of a semiconducting material. It consists of a core `Segment` class that calculates the effective mass and other associated properties of selected bandstructure segments. The programme also contains functions for locating bandstructure extrema, constructing segments and plotting approximations to the dispersion. There is a command line interface for calculating parabolic effective mass values, and an API for the more complex, non-parabolic definitions of effective mass.

If you use `effmass` for your published research [please cite accordingly](#citing-effmass).

## Release 2.0.0

üíÉ `effmass` now interfaces with more codes:
- it can read in Castep output data (in addition to Vasp and FHI-aims)
- it can work with ASE bandstructure objects

üíÉ `effmass` now includes a command line interface

![](./cli2.gif)  

As a result of these changes, and with view to supporting more DFT codes in the future, the `Data` class has been renamed to `DataVasp` ‚ö†Ô∏è **On updating to the latest version of effmass you may need to update your scripts / Jupyter Notebook to reflect this change** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Features

`effmass` can:

**Read in a bandstructure:**
It is assumed you have used a DFT calculator to walk through a 1D slice of the Brillouin Zone, capturing the maxima and minima of interest. `effmass` uses the Python package [vasppy](https://github.com/bjmorgan/vasppy) for parsing `VASP` output.

**Locate extrema:**
These correspond to the valence band maxima and conduction band minima. Maxima and minima within a certain energy range can also be located.

**Calculate curvature, transport and optical effective masses:**
The curvature (aka inertial) and transport masses are calculated using the derivatives of a fitted polynomial function. The optical effective mass can also be calculated assuming a Kane dispersion.

**Assess the extent of non-parabolicity:**
Parameters of the Kane quasi-linear dispersion are calculated to quantify the extent of non-parabolicity over a given energy range. 

**Calculate the quasi-fermi level for a given carrier concentration:**
Using density-of-states data and assuming no thermal smearing, `effmass` can calculate the energy to which states are occupied. This is a useful approximation to the quasi-Fermi level. *Note: this is only supported for VASP and requires the output file `DOSCAR`.* 

**Plot fits to the dispersion:**
Selected bandstructure segments and approximations to the dispersion (assuming a Kane, quadratic, or higher order fit) can be visualised.

The [command line interface](#Installation) provides basic functionality for calculating parabolic effective masses.
For those who have a basic familiarity with Python there is an API which provides access to all features, including non-parabolic effective mass definitions. 

Depending on the functionality and level of approximation you are looking for, 
it may be that one of the packages listed [here](https://effmass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Related%20packages.html) will suit your needs better.

## Supported Codes

`effmass` currently supports `VASP`, `FHI-Aims`, `Castep` and `ASE`. In the near future we hope to play nicely with other codes that interface with the ASE bandstructure class, and pymatgen. We especially welcome contributions that will help make `effmass` available to more researchers.

## Installation

`effmass` can then be installed using the Python package manager `pip`:

```
pip install effmass
```

To start the command line interface simply type

```
effmass
```

If you do not use `pip` you can download and install the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/lucydot/effmass/releases):
```
cd effmass
python setup.py install
```
