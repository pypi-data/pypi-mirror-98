Tempest Integration of Barbican
===============================

This project defines a tempest plugin containing tests used to verify the
functionality of a barbican installation. The plugin will automatically load
these tests into tempest.

Dependencies
------------
The barbican_tempest_plugin tests the barbican quota API, which requires the
existence of the 'key-manager:service-admin' role in barbican. The quota API
tests will fail if this role is not defined.
