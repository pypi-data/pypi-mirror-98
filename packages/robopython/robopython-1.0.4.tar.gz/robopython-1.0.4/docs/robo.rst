Drive
#####

| 	
| ``vel`` is the desired velocity from 0-100%
| ``distance`` is how far in centimeters Robo should drive
| ``direction`` will detirmine forward or backward
| ``wait`` is a flag that indicates if we wait in the function until the action is complete. set wait = 0 if we want to exit the function while driving
| ``motors`` is a tuple of the two motors used to drive Robo
| ``wd`` is the diameter of the wheels used, default is 89mm or 0x59mm in hex. 
| If you choose to change the wheels be sure to pass in the new wheel diameter

	my_robo.drive(80, 30, 1)

Drive Forever

| drive_inf(``self``, ``vel``, ``direction``)
|
| ``vel`` is the desired velocity from 0-100%

	my_robo.drive_inf(80, 1)

Turn Forever
############

| turn_inf(``self``, ``vel``, ``direction``)
|
| ``vel`` is the desired velocity from 0-100%

Get Robo Build
##############

| get_build(``self``)
|
| returns a list of Robo Wunderkind moduels that are currently attached
| The is updated automatically upon initialization of Robo object as well as when there has been a change in the build
| The latest build is stored in self.build -> my_robo.build	

::

	build = my_robo.get_build()
	
Get BLE Characteristics
#######################

| get_characteristics(``self``)
|

########

| get_rssi(``self``)
|
| rssi = my_robo.get_rssi()
| returns the BLE signal strength rssi value

Set Drive Command
#################

| set_drive(``self``, ``motor_cmds``, ``vel``, ``distance``, ``action_id``, ``wd=0x59``)
|
| set_drive is Robo's generic command to set the velocity and distance commands to multiple motors at once
|
| ``motor_cmds`` is a list of motor objects folloed by the direction that motor should spin: [[1,0],[2,1],[3,0],[4,1]] motors from 1-6 are valid if connected
| ``vel`` is the desired velocity from 0-100%
| ``distance`` is the desired distance to travel in centimeters
| ``action_id`` is a unique identifier that is sent back once Robo has completed the action. Use the self.drive_id by default, use check_drive_action() to know when it is done
| ``wd`` is the diameter of the wheels used, default is 89mm or 0x59mm in hex. If you choose to change the wheels be sure to pass in the new wheel diameter

::	

	my_robo.set_drive([[1,0],[2,1],[3,0],[4,1]], 50, 100, my_robo.drive_id)

Turn
####

| turn(``self``, ``vel``, ``angle``, ``direction``, ``wait=1``, ``motors=(1, 2)``, ``wd=89``, ``turning_radius=91``)
| 
| turn is Robo's simplified command to have Robo turn a number of degrees assuming a 2 motor configuration
| 
| ``vel`` is the desired velocity from 0-100%
| ``angle`` is the amount to have Robo turn in degrees
| ``direction`` will detirmine clockwise or counter clockwise rotation
| ``wait`` is a flag that indicates if we wait in the function until the turn is complete. set wait = 0 if we want to exit the function while turning
| ``motors`` is a tuple of the two motors used to turn Robo
| ``wd`` is the diameter of the wheels used, default is 89mm or 0x59mm in hex. If you choose to change the wheels be sure to pass in the new wheel diameter
| ``turning_radius`` is the distance from the wheel to the centre of Robo's turning axle in millimeters
