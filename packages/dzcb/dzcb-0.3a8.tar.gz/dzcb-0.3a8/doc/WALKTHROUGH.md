# [`example-codeplug`](https://github.com/mycodeplug/example-codeplug) walkthough

## Assumptions

* Windows 10
* Github.com Account [[Sign-up]](https://github.com/join)
* [Github Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)

The walkthrough will show screenshots of these tools, however
the concepts are applicable to excel, linux, or git command line.

## Fork [`example-codeplug`](https://github.com/mycodeplug/example-codeplug)

"Fork" means to make a linked copy of the example-codeplug that you can
edit without affecting the original.

Go to [https://github.com/mycodeplug/example-codeplug](https://github.com/mycodeplug/example-codeplug).
Click "Fork" (not the number next to it)

[<img src="./walkthrough/fork-button.png" alt="click fork and select your account">](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masenf/dzcb/walkthru/doc/walkthrough/forking.webm)

## Rename Your New Fork

Your new fork is a "git repository" containing the files needed to 
generate your customized codeplug. **You only need to make a
fork once.**

### Open Settings

Sometimes Settings is hidden behind the three dots menu.

<img src="./walkthrough/settings1.png" alt="sometimes settings is hidden behind the three dots menu">

### Choose a new name

<img src="./walkthrough/settings-rename.png" alt="pick a descriptive name or use callsign">

Click Rename.

## Enable Github Actions

Click Actions tab.

<img src="./walkthrough/enable-actions.png" alt="I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them">

Click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"

# Customizing

To customize the codeplug, you need to download ("clone") the repository
to your computer. Modify the files in the `input` directory. Make a "commit"
describing your change. And finally upload ("push") the repository back to
Github to generate the codeplug.

## Clone your fork

Start Github Desktop and sign in with your Github Account.

<img src="./walkthrough/github-desktop-home.png">

From the list of repositories, select your new fork ("shiney-new-codeplug"
in this example), and click "Clone youruser/your-codeplug". 

Next, choose where to download the repository, or keep the defaults.

<img src="./walkthrough/github-desktop-clone.png">

Click Clone.

Wait patiently until asked
"How are you planning to use this fork?", then select
"For my own purposes".

<img src="./walkthrough/github-desktop-clone2.png">

Click Continue.

## Make Changes to Source Files

From the repository main screen in Github Desktop, click
"Show in Explorer" to view the files

<img src="./walkthrough/github-desktop-repo.png">

When the explorer window opens, double click "input" then "default"
to view the example code plug source files.

<img src="./walkthrough/explorer-default.png">

The `.json` and `.sh` files are plain text and can be opened with
notepad for editing.

### Set DMR Number and Callsign

Double click `example-md-uv380.json`, click the "More Apps êœœ" link
and choose Notepad from the list.

<img src="./walkthrough/explorer-open-with.png">

From Edit > Find... search for `"RadioID`.

<img src="./walkthrough/notepad-find.png">

Replace "1234567" with your DMR number.

Scroll down a bit and replace "AA1AA" with your callsign

<img src="./walkthrough/notepad-changed.png">

Close Notepad and save the file.

### Add a new Hotspot Talkgroup (example)

Open the "k7abd" directory and load "Talkgroups__Hotspot.csv" into
Libreoffice (or Excel).

Add the new talkgroup, BC on brandmeister, `30271`.

<img src="./walkthrough/calc-talkgroups-hotspot.png">

It may be convenient to keep your CSV files sorted alphabetically or otherwise,
however dzcb will re-order combined zones and expanded talkgroups according to
`order.json` (see below).

Save the file. **Use Text CSV Format!**

### Add a new Simplex Hotspot (example)

Load "Digital-Repeaters__Hotspot.csv". **Uncheck the "Semicolon" box when loading!**

The example file already includes 2 zones for a duplex
hotspot. To create a zone for a simplex hotspot, add
a new row based on the existing rows. You can also
rename the existing zones and modify the RX / TX frequencies
instead of creating a new row.

To the right of "Color Code" the remaining column headers correspond to
talkgroup names. Going across the row, a "-", "1", or "2" indicates
whether to create a channel in the zone on the given frequency and timeslot.

<img src="./walkthrough/calc-digital-repeaters-hotspot.png">

Next scroll to the far right and add a new column corresponding
to the "BC" talkgroup that was added in the previous section.

Enter a "-", "1", or "2" in each cell of the BC column indicating
whether the zone should create a channel for the talkgroup
on timeslot 1 or timeslot 2.

<img src="./walkthrough/calc-digital-repeaters-bc.png">

Save the file. **Use Text CSV Format!**

### Edit `order.csv`, `exclude.csv`, and `replacements.csv`

The newly added zone can be placed at the top of the zone list
by editing `order.csv` and adding a line matching the
new zone name.

**Any zones not in the list will follow in alphabetical order
(by K7ABD CSV filename)**.

The columns in these CSV files correspond to codeplug objects,
most commonly used are `contacts`, `channels`, and `zones`.

Each column should contain regular expressions that match
the name of the object of interest. See [README.md](/README.md#customization)
for further explaination of customizations.

Save the files. **Use Text CSV Format!**

### Commit changes

Switch back to Github Desktop and review the changes that were made.

In the lower left, describe the change and click "Commit to main"

<img src="./walkthrough/github-desktop-commit.png">

### Push commits

A "push" uploads your changes to github.com and starts the
codeplug generation.

<img src="./walkthrough/github-desktop-push.png">

Click "Push origin"

### View progress

Click "View on Github"

<img src="./walkthrough/github-desktop-view-on-github.png">

When the browser opens, click the "Actions" tab. You should see the
codeplug being built.

<img src="./walkthrough/github-actions-overview.png">

### Check Codeplug

After a minute or two, the codeplug should be ready. From the build
summary, scroll down to the "Artifacts" section to download
codeplugs.zip with the generated codeplug!

<img src="./walkthrough/github-actions-artifacts.png">

Import the files into your preferred CPS and check that
the new zone and channel is added.

# Enable Repeaterbook

The `prox.csv` file in the `input` directory identifies points
of interest used to download repeater information from repeaterbook.com.

## Add a new analog zone

Back in the "input\default" directory, open `prox.csv`.

Add new zones by providing coordinates, distance, and band
id (14 - 2 meter, 4 - 70 centimeter). Follow the existing
examples for guidance.

XXX: image below shows the old format! Follow the format in the
example-codeplug's `prox.csv` file.

<img src="./walkthrough/calc-prox-new.png">

Save the file. **Use Text CSV Format!**

## Commit and push

Go back to Github Desktop, make a new commit, and Push
to origin as seen in a previous step.

Github Actions will build your changed codeplug.

# Publish and Share

After checking that the codeplug meets expectations and
is functional, go back to the Code tab of your forked repo
and select "Releases" in the right column.

<img src="./walkthrough/github-code-releases.png">

<img src="./walkthrough/github-releases-main.png">

Click Draft a new release.

For the "Tag version" box, enter the date in ISO format: `2021-01-26`

"Release title" and "Describe this release" are optional and can
be edited later.

<img src="./walkthrough/github-releases-publish.png">

Click Publish release.

This will trigger another Github Actions rebuild of your codeplug.

Wait a few minutes and then refresh the page.

<img src="./walkthrough/github-releases-assets.png">

When the codeplug has been generated, you will see `codeplugs.zip`
under the "Assets" section of the release.

Github will host your codeplug indefinitely, you may right click
`codeplugs.zip` and "Copy link location" to share the generated codeplug
with others.
