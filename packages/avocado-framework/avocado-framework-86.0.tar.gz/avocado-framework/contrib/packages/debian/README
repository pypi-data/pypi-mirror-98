This is a collection of files that are useful to generate packages for
Debian(-like) systems.  Their "contrib" status mean that they should
work, but there's no support for them.

If there are users out there interested in keeping Debian(-like)
packages update, please step up.

The basic usage is to run the various targets defined in the Makefile,
such as running `make deb` to have both source and binary packages
generated.
