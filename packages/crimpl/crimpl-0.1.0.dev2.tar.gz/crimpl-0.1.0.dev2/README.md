**IMPORTANT**: **crimpl** is currently still under development, is not yet well-tested, and is subject to significant API changes.  Please keep posted until an official release is ready.

Read the [latest documentation on readthedocs](https://crimpl.readthedocs.io) or [browse the current documentation](./docs/index.md).


**crimpl** provides high-level python object-oriented interfaces to manage running scripts on remote compute resources.

Each type of server implements a `s.run_script` which runs a given set of commands remotely on the server, showing the output, and waiting for completion, and `s.submit_script` which starts the script running on the server and detaches while allowing for monitoring its progress remotely.  They also each include a `s.check_output` for copying expected output files back to the local machine.


## Documentation and API Docs

The configuration, options, and capabilities of each type of server are explored in [the latest documentation on readthedocs](https://crimpl.readthedocs.io) or [browse the current documentation](./docs/index.md).
