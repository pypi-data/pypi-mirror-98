Description: # CNN2SNN toolkit
        
        The Brainchip CNN2SNN toolkit provides a means to convert Convolutional Neural
        Networks (CNN) that were trained using Deep Learning methods to a low-latency 
        and low-power Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for use with the Akida Execution
        Engine (AEE).
