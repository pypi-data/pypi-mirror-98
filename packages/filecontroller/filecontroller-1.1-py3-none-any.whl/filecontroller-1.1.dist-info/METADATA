# FileController

FileController is a Python 3 project that can make file management in Python easier than ever. It includes all
basic file commands (read, write, delete, create) and even more powerful tools. The project is still in
development with even more features coming out, but for now it has only the basic file commands + zip management.

## Installation

To install the file:
1. Open up CMD and type 'pip install filecontroller'
2. Open up any python project
3. Import the file like this: 'from filecontroller import fileController'
4. Give it a reference name: 'your_reference_name = fileController()'
5. You can now use it by typing 'your_reference_name.' and see all the available options

### Usage

Here is an example code to read a file:
```
from filecontroller import fileController
file = fileController()

file.readFile('test_file.txt')
```
