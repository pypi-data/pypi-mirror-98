For a given variable, the ``ParentValues`` column of the variable table may
contain one or more *expressions*, which define conditions that parent
variables of the variable may meet in order for the variable value to be
replaced. This module contains logic for parsing and evaluating a single
expression - the evaluation of multiple comma-separated expressions is handled
in the :mod:`.importing` module.


An *expression* comprises one or more *conditional statements* (or
*statements* for short). A statement has the form::

    variable operator value

where:

  - ``variable`` is the ID of a parent variable of the variable in question.
    Variable IDs must be an integer preceded by the letter ``v``.
  - ``operator`` is a comparison operator (e.g. equals, greater than, etc.).
  - ``value`` is one of:
      - ``'na'`` indicating missing,
      - a numeric value against which the parent variable is to be compared.
      - a non-numeric value (i.e. a string), against which the parent variable
        is to be compared. The value must be quoted with either single or
        double quotes.

The following comparison operators are allowed (and the symbols used in a
statement can be found in the :attr:`SYMBOLS` dictionary):

 - equal to
 - not equal to
 - greater than
 - greater than or equal to
 - less than
 - less than or equal to


The *equal to* and *not equal to* operators may be used with a value of
``'na'`` to test whether the values for a variable are missing or present
respectively. Similarly, the *equal to* and *not equal to* operators may be
used with a non-numeric value to test for string equality.

Multiple conditional statements may be combined with ``and``, ``or``, and
``not`` logical operations (specific symbols can be found in the
:attr:`SYMBOLS` dictionary), and precedence may be enforced with the use of
round brackets.

The ``any`` and ``all`` operations can be applied to statements which have
been evaluated on multiple columns to combine the results column-wise.

    The ``parseExpression`` function, given an expression string, will return

    function expects to be given two arguments:

    - A ``pandas.DataFrame`` which contains the data on all variables used
      in the expression
    - A dictionary containing ``{variable : column}`` mappings from the
      variables used in the expression to the columns of the data frame.

    An expression function will simply return ``True`` or ``False``, depending
    on the outcome of the expression.

    Expression functions have a few attributes containing metadata about the
    expression:

      - ``ftype`` contains the expression type, either ``unary`` (for *not*,
        *any* and *all* operations),
        ``binary`` (for *and*/*or* operations), or ``condition`` (for
        comparison operations)
      - ``operation`` contains the operation symbol

    Boolean *and*/*or* functions contain ``operand1`` and ``operand2``
    attributes which refer to the expression functions they will be applied
    to. Similarly, boolean *not* functions contain an ``operand`` attribute
    which refers to the expression function it will be applied to.  Comparison
    expression functions contain ``variable`` and ``value`` attributes, which
    contain the variable name and the value involved in the comparison.

    occurs when the operands of a binary operator have a different number of
