Now supply the version of the package during Sphinx
setup.

Also supply "parallel_read_safe=True" to be explicit

parallel reads.

Refreshed package metadata.

===

Replacer now adds the Sphinx config namespace to the
replacements, meaning that names like ``project``

plugin, which supplies a ``package_url``.
