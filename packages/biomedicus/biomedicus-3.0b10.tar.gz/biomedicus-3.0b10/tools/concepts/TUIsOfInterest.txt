STY|T017|Anatomical Structure|A1.2|A normal or pathological part of the anatomy or structural organization of an organism.||Few concepts will be assigned to this broad type.|Y|anst||
STY|T019|Congenital Abnormality|A1.2.2.1|An abnormal structure, or one that is abnormal in size or location, present at birth or evolving over time as a result of a defect in embryogenesis.||If the congenital abnormality involves multiple defects then the type 'Disease or Syndrome' will also be assigned.||cgab||
STY|T020|Acquired Abnormality|A1.2.2.2|An abnormal structure, or one that is abnormal in size or location, found in or deriving from a previously normal structure. Acquired abnormalities are distinguished from diseases even though they may result in pathological functioning (e.g., "hernias incarcerate").||NULL||acab||
STY|T022|Body System|A2.1.4.1|A complex of anatomical structures that performs a common function.||NULL||bdsy||
STY|T023|Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component|A1.2.3.1|A collection of cells and tissues which are localized to a specific area or combine and carry out one or more specialized functions of an organism.

STY|T033|Finding|A2.2|That which is discovered by direct observation or measurement of an organism attribute or condition, including the clinical history of the patient. The history of the presence of a disease is a 'Finding' and is distinguished from the disease itself.||Only in rare circumstances will findings be double-typed with either 'Pathologic Function' or 'Anatomical Abnormality'. Most findings will be assigned the types 'Laboratory or Test Result' or 'Sign or Symptom'. Only those findings that relate to patient history or to the determination of a state will be assigned the type 'Finding'.||fndg||
STY|T034|Laboratory or Test Result|A2.2.1|The outcome of a specific test to measure an attribute or to determine the presence, absence, or degree of a condition.||Laboratory or test results are considered inherently quantitative and, thus, are not assigned the additional type 'Quantitative Concept'.||lbtr||

Included here are normal responses to a negative stimulus as well as patholologic conditions or states that are less specific than a disease. Pathologic functions frequently have systemic effects.||If the process is specific, for example to a site or substance, then 'Disease or Syndrome' will be assigned and not 'Pathologic Function'. For example, "cerebral anoxia", "brain edema", and "milk hypersensitivity" will all be assigned to 'Disease or Syndrome' only.||patf||
STY|T047|Disease or Syndrome|B2.2.1.2.1|A condition which alters or interferes with a normal process, state, or activity of an organism.

Included here is a complex of symptoms descriptive of a disorder.||Any specific disease or syndrome that is modified by such modifiers as "acute", "prolonged", etc. will also be assigned to this type. If an anatomic abnormality has a pathologic manifestation, then it will be given this type as well as a type from the 'Anatomical Abnormality' hierarchy, e.g., "Diabetic Cataract" will be double-typed for this reason.||dsyn||
STY|T048|Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction|B2.2.1.2.1.1|A clinically significant dysfunction whose major manifestation is behavioral or psychological. These dysfunctions may have identified or presumed biological etiologies or manifestations.||NULL||mobd||
STY|T053|Behavior|B1.1|Any of the psycho-social activities of humans or animals that can be observed directly by others or can be made systematically observable by the use of special strategies.||Few concepts will be assigned to this broad type. For concepts assigned to the 'Behavior' hierarchy, the focus of interest is on the individual or group that is carrying out the activity. When the activity is of paramount interest, then a type from the 'Activity' hierarchy will be chosen. In general, concepts will not receive a type from both the 'Behavior' and the 'Activity' hierarchies.|Y|bhvr||
STY|T054|Social Behavior|B1.1.1|Behavior that is a direct result or function of the interaction of humans or animals with their fellows.

STY|T055|Individual Behavior|B1.1.2|Behavior exhibited by a human or an animal that is not a direct result of interaction with other members of the species, but which may have an effect on others.||'Individual Behavior' is carried out by an individual, though others may be present, and is, thus, distinguished from 'Social Behavior' which requires the direct participation of others.||inbe||

STY|T074|Medical Device|A1.3.1|A manufactured object used primarily in the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of physiologic or anatomic disorders.||A medical device may be used for research purposes, but since its primary use is for routine medical care, it is distinguished from a 'Research Device' which is used primarily for research purposes.||medd||
STY|T097|Professional or Occupational Group|A2.9.1|An individual or individuals classified according to their vocation.||If the concept refers to the discipline or vocation itself, rather than to the individuals who have the vocation, then the type 'Occupation or Discipline' will be assigned instead.||prog||
