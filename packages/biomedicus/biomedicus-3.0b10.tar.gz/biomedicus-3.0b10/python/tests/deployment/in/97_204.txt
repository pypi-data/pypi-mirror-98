HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Thank you for referring Ms. Abc to ABCD Nephrology.  As you know she is a 51-year-old lady who was found to have a creatinine of 2.4 on a recent hospital admission to XYZ Hospital.  She had been admitted at that time with chest pain and was subsequently transferred to University of A and had a cardiac catheterization, which did not show any coronary artery disease.  She also was found to have a urinary tract infection at that time and this was treated with ciprofloxacin.  Her creatinine both at XYZ Hospital and University of A was elevated at 2.4.  I do not have the results from the prior years.  A repeat creatinine on 08/16/06 was 2.3.  The patient reports that she had gastric bypass surgery in 1975 and since then has had chronic diarrhea and recurrent admissions to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.  She also mentioned that lately she has had a lot of urinary tract infections without any symptoms and was in the emergency room four months ago with a urinary tract infection.  She had bladder studies a long time ago.  She complains of frequency of urination for a long time but denies any dysuria, urgency, or hematuria.  She also mentioned that she was told sometime in the past that she had kidney stones but does not recall any symptoms suggestive of kidney stones.  She denies any nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use.  She denies any other over-the-counter medication use.  She has chronic hypokalemia and has been on potassium supplements recently.
