Description: # py_thorlabs_tsp
        
        Low and high level python wrappers for Thorlabs TSP01B temperature and humidity
        sensor. 
        
        This is an unofficial package and is not supported by the vendor 
        of equipment.
        
        This package provides: 
        1. low-level functions, which are thin wrappers around the C-functions
        from the DLL distributed by Thorlabs; 
        2. high-level class for connecting to the sensor and getting temperature and 
        humidity readout.
        
        This package was tested on Windows only. Only TSP01 **Rev.B** sensor was 
        tested. 
        
        Installation
        ------------
        #### Prerequisites
        
        Download and install the software from 
        [thorlabs.com](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=5884), 
        choose *Software* tab. 
        This program provides the drivers (DLLs discoverable by the py_thorlabs_tsp), 
        and also the *TSP01 Application*, which has a GUI and allows connecting
        and reading out the sensor.
        
        The package itself can be installed either from pypi or from the repository.
        See both options below.
