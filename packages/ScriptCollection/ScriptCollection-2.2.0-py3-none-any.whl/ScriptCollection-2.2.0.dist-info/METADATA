# ScriptCollection ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ScriptCollection)

This repository is the place for little scripts which are also useful in future so that someone does not have remember them and write them new from scratch. You can simply use the scripts.

## Functions

TODO

## Hints

Most of the scripts are written in [python](https://www.python.org) 3.

Caution: Before executing **any** script of this repository read the sourcecode of the script (and the sourcecode of all functions called by this function directly or transitively) carefully and verify that the script does exactly what you want to do and nothing else.

Some functions are not entirely available on windows or require common third-party tools. See the [Runtime-Dependencies](#Runtime-Dependencies)-section for more information.

## Get ScriptCollection

### Installation via pip

`pip install ScriptCollection`

pip requires [Python](https://www.python.org) 3. See the [PyPI-site for ScriptCollection](https://pypi.org/project/ScriptCollection)

### Download sourcecode using git

You can simply git-clone the ScriptCollection and then use the scripts under the provided license.

`git clone https://github.com/anionDev/ScriptCollection`

It may be more easy to pip-install the ScriptCollection but technically pip is not required. Actually you need to git-clone (or download as zip-file from [Github](https://github.com/anionDev/ScriptCollection) the ScriptCollection to use the scripts in this repository which are not written in python.

## Troubleshooting

It is recommended to always use only the newest version of the ScriptCollection. If you have an older version: Update it (e. g. using `pip install ScriptCollection --upgrade` if you installed the ScriptCollection via pip). If you still have problems, then feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/anionDev/ScriptCollection/issues).

If you have installed the ScriptCollection as pip-package you can simply check the version using Python with the following commands:

```lang-bash
from ScriptCollection.core import get_ScriptCollection_version
get_ScriptCollection_version()
```

Or you can simply run `pip freeze` folder to get information about (all) currently installed pip-packages.

## Development

### Install dependencies

To develop ScriptCollection it is obviously required that the following commandline-commands are available on your system:

- `python` (on some systems `python3`)
- `pip` (on some systems `pip3`)

To install all required pip-packages simply execute the following commands:

```lang-bash
pip install "keyboard>=0.13.5"
pip install "ntplib>=0.3.4"
pip install "pycdlib>=1.10.0"
pip install "PyPDF2>=1.26.0"
pip install "qrcode>=6.1"
pip install "send2trash>=1.5.0"
pip install "pylint>=2.6.0"
pip install "pytest>=6.1.2"
pip install "wheel>=0.35.1"
```

### IDE

The recommended IDE for developing ScriptCollection is Visual Studio Code.
The recommended addons for developing ScriptCollection with Visual Studio Code are:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Python Test Explorer for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LittleFoxTeam.vscode-python-test-adapter)
- [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)
- [docs-markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=docsmsft.docs-markdown)

### Build

To Create an installable whl-package simply execute `python Setup.py bdist_wheel --dist-dir .`.

## Runtime-Dependencies

The usual Python-dependencies will be installed automagically by pip.

For functions to to read or change the permissions or the owner of a file the ScriptCollection relies on the functionality of the following tools:

- chmod
- chown
- ls

This tools must be available on the system where the functions should be executed. Meanwhile this tools are also available on Windows but may have a slightly limited functionality.
