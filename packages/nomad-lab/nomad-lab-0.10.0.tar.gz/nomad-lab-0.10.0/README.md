This project implements the new *nomad@FAIRDI* infrastructure. Contrary to its NOMAD CoE
predecessor, it implements the NOMAD Repository and NOMAD Archive functionality within
a single cohesive application. This project provides all necessary artifacts to develop,
test, deploy, and operate the NOMAD Respository and Archive, e.g. at
[https://nomad-lab.eu](https://nomad-lab.eu).

In the future, this project's aim is to integrate more NOMAD CoE components, like the NOMAD
Encyclopedia and NOMAD Analytics Toolkit, to fully integrate NOMAD with one GUI and consistent
APIs. Furthermore, this projects aims at establishing NOMAD as a distributed platform for
material science data sharing and management. This includes the on-site deployment of
NOMAD as a standalone service (*oasis*), the federated use of NOMAD through a
serious of full and partial *mirrors*, the integration of 3rd party material science
databases (i.e. [Aflow](http://www.aflow.org/), [OQMD](http://oqmd.org/),
[Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/)), and support for open APIs and
standards like the [Optimade](http://www.optimade.org/) API.


## Getting started

### Using NOMAD as a Python package

You can install the `nomad` Python package from source distribution with pip. Please
note, that this will only install part of NOMAD's dependencies that will only allow
your to use NOMAD's client library, e.g. to access the NOMAD Archive.
```
pip install nomad-lab
```

To **use the NOMAD parsers for example**, install the `parsing` extra:
```
pip install nomad-lab[parsing]
nomad parse --show-archive <your-file-to-parse>
```

### For NOMAD developer

Read the [docs](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/rae/docs/index.html). The documentation is also part
of the source code. It covers aspects like introduction, architecture, development setup/deployment,
contributing, and API reference.


## Change log

Omitted versions are plain bugfix releases with only minor changes and fixes.

### v0.10.0
- The entries page shows visualizations for key properties of the underlying data

- Encyclopedia with dedicated materials search index.

### v0.9.0
- The encyclopedia runs on top of the new infrastructure. The GUIs are integrated via
  bi-lateral navigation between entries.
- The parsers have new documentation and development instructions and can be easily developed
  based on NOMAD's PyPi package nomad-lab
- We introduce workflow metadata (starting with geometry optimizations). This includes search
  for workflow parameter, and 3-tiered archive storage for quick access to results for analytics.
- A new GUI to browse  the Archive and Metainfo
- The Artificial Intelligence Toolkit (at least its tutorial page) is part of the GUI
- The OASIS comprises Repository, Archive, Metainfo, Encyclopedia, and Artificial Intelligence Toolkit.

### v0.8.7

- properties and user tab in the search GUI
- improved performance on most parsers
- NOMAD source distribution
