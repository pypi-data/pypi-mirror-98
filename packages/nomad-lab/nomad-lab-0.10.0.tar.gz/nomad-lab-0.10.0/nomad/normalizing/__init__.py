After parsing calculations have to be normalized with a set of *normalizers*.
In NOMAD-coe those were programmed in python (we'll reuse) and scala (we'll rewrite).

Currently the normalizers are:
- system.py (contains aspects of format stats, system, system type, and symmetry normalizer)
- optimade.py
- fhiaims.py
- dos.py
- encyclopedia.py (used to create the data in NOMAD-coe Encyclopedia)

The normalizers are available via

.. autodata:: nomad.normalizing.normalizers

There is one ABC for all normalizer:

.. autoclass::nomad.normalizing.normalizer.Normalizer
