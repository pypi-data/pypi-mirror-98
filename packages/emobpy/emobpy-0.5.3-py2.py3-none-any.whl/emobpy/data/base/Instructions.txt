Base case:

The creation of 
    - 6 mobility profiles
    - 1 consumption profiles
    - 1 grid availability profiles
    - 4 grid demand profiles

Before running this example, install and activate an emobpy dedicated environment (conda recommended). Install emobpy in the environment if it is not yet installed (pip install emobpy).

Run the script in the following order:

    python mobility.py
    
    python DrivingConsumption.py
    
    python GridAvailability.py
    
    python GridDemand.py
    
    
After finishing all the runs open the notebook for visualtization and export results.

    
See the documentation to convert pickle files to CSV and use visualtization tools.
