This is the **shenfun** package

What is **shenfun**?
================================

``Shenfun`` is a high performance computing platform for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) by the spectral Galerkin method. The user
interface to shenfun is very similar to
`FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org>`_, but applications are limited to
multidimensional tensor product grids. The code is parallelized with MPI
through the `mpi4py-fft <https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py-fft>`_
package.

``Shenfun`` enables fast development of efficient and accurate PDE solvers
(spectral order and accuracy), in the comfortable high-level Python language.
The spectral accuracy is ensured from using high-order *global* orthogonal
basis functions (Fourier, Legendre, Chebyshev, Laguerre, Hermite and Jacobi),
as opposed to finite element codes like `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org>`_
that are using low-order *local* basis functions. Efficiency is ensured
through vectorization (`Numpy <https://www.numpy.org/>`_), parallelization
(`mpi4py <https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py>`_) and by moving critical
routines to `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_.

``Shenfun`` has support for solving scalar and vector equations in curvilinear
coordinates, like polar or spherical coordinates.
