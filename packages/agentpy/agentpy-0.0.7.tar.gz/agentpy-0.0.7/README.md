Agentpy is an open-source library for the development and analysis of agent-based models in Python. 
The framework integrates the tasks of model design, numerical experiments, 
and data analysis within a single environment, and is optimized for interactive computing 
with [IPython](http://ipython.org/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). If
you have questions or ideas for improvements, please visit the 
[discussion forum](https://github.com/JoelForamitti/agentpy/discussions)
or subscribe to the [agentpy mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/agentpy).
