# Installing TuxMake via RPM packages

TuxMake provides RPM packages that have minimal dependencies, and should work
on any RPM-based (Ubuntu, etc) system. The instructions below were tested on
Fedora 33, you may need to adapt them to your system.

1) Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/tuxmake.repo` with the following contents:

```
[tuxmake]
name=tuxmake
type=rpm-md
baseurl=https://tuxmake.org/packages/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://tuxmake.org/packages/repodata/repomd.xml.key
enabled=1

```

2) Install tuxmake as you would any other package:

```
# dnf install tuxmake
```

Upgrades will be available in the same repository, so you can get them using
the same procedure you already use to get other updates for your system.
