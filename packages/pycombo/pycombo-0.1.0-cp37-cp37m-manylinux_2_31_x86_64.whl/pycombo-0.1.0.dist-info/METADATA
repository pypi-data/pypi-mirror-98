# pyCOMBO
![CI](https://github.com/Casyfill/pyCombo/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

pyCombo is a python wrapper around [C++ implementation](https://github.com/Alexander-Belyi/Combo) of the [network] community detection algorithm called "Combo".

Details of the algorithm are described in the paper "General optimization technique for high-quality community detection in the paper:

```
Sobolevsky, S., Campari, R., Belyi, A. and Ratti, C., 2014. General optimization technique for high-quality community detection in complex networks. Physical Review E, 90(1), p.012811.
```

## Installation
You can install current version of pycombo from github by executing
```bash
python -m pip install https://github.com/Casyfill/pyCombo/archive/master.tar.gz#egg=pycombo
```

## Example
The basic usage is as follows:
```python
import pycombo
import networkx as nx

partition = pycombo.execute(nx.karate_club_graph())
```
More examples could be found in [example](https://github.com/Casyfill/pyCombo/tree/master/example) folder.

## Dependencies
*pyCombo* does not have any dependency, yet it was created having [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) module in mind.

## Why Combo?
![algorithm comparison](http://senseable.mit.edu/community_detection/img/plot_yoon_01.png)

Combo achieves hight quality of partitioning, while being less greedy in terms of computation, than other algorithms.

# Notes and issues
- for now c++ sources duplicate https://github.com/Alexander-Belyi/Combo

# Development
Feel free to fork this repo and submit pull requests.

## Local development
Run `poetry install` in order to install local (dev) code.
It will be installed in editable mode within poetry environment.

## Build
To build distributions run `poetry build`.
