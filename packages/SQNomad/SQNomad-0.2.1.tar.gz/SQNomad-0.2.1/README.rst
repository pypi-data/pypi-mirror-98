NOMAD - A blackbox optimization software
========================================

NOMAD is a C++ implementation of the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm
(MADS), designed for difficult blackbox optimization problems. These problems
occur when the functions defining the objective and constraints are the
result of costly computer simulations.

This version of NOMAD was modified and redistributed under the rules of LGPL.
