Author: Hartmut Goebel

* Add support for Python 3. Minimum required Python version is now
  Python 2.7.

* Documentation is extended and includes API documentation.

:sieveshell:
   - Security fix: No longer leak environment variable SIEVE_PASSWORD
     when displaying usage help.
   - Per default enforce secure transport. Suggested by Jan Zerebecki.
   - Add possibility to use username/password from the .netrc file.
     The order is: command line options -> environment variables ->
     .netrc file -> ask user. Thanks to Grégoire Détrez.

:managesieve:
   - Fail if TLS is requested, but server doesn't support TLS.
     Suggested by Jan Zerebecki.

:project:
   - Rework and enhance test-suite. Thanks to Matěj Cepl for nudging
     to proper pytest integration.
   - Lots if internal cleanup.


Version 0.5 (2013-03-24)
----------------------------

Author: Hartmut Goebel

:sieveshell:
  - Changed default port for the MANAGESIEVE protocol to 4190 as
    proposed by RFC 5804. Thanks to Guido Berhoerster for submitting
    the patch.
  - Added option ``--port``. Thanks to Damien Aumaitre for submitting
    the patch and to Guido Berhoerster for an enhancement.
  - Added option ``--verbose`` for controlling debug output in
    managesieve. May be given several times to increase verbosity.

:managesieve:
  - Switched to Python standard logging system.
    This introduces a minor interface change: MANAGESIEVE.debug and
    global Debug are gone. See source for information about debugging
    log levels.


Version 0.4.2 (2010-01-06)
----------------------------

Author: Hartmut Goebel

:managesieve:
  - Use ssl.wrap_socket() instead of deprecated socket.ssl().
    Thanks to Guido Berhoerster for submitting the patch.


Version 0.4.1 (2009-10-08)
----------------------------

Author: Hartmut Goebel

:managesieve:
  - fixed short read (thanks to paurkedal for submitting the patch)


Version 0.4 (2008-10-13)
----------------------------

Author: Hartmut Goebel

:managesieve:
  - now work with Python 2.3 and later
  - added support for TLS (STARTTLS), special thanks to Gregory Boyce
    for fixing some corner cases here
  - added support for PLAIN authentication
  - use optparse if available instead of optik.
  - API change: login() no longer uses the LOGIN authentication
    mechanism, but has become a  convenience function. It uses the best
    mechanism available for authenticating the user.

  * Bugfixes:

    - If a capability had no values (like 'STARTTLS'), parsing
      capabilities failed. Fixed.
    - removed dependency on some imaplib's private functions
    - fixed typo: self.supports_tls

  Thanks to Tomas 'Skitta' Lindroos, Lorenzo Boccaccia, Alain Spineux,
  darkness and Gregory Boyce for sending patches.

:sieveshell:
  - added support for different authentication mechanisms
  - added option --start-tls
  - more verbose output when server says "BYE" (prints out referrals
    etc.)
  - automatic cmd_quit() when server says "BYE"
  - several minor bugfixes and enhancements


Version 0.3
----------------------------

Author: Hartmut Goebel

:managesieve:
  - MANAGESIEVE.authenticate() now only returns a OK/NO/BYE result
    like any command not asking data from the server

:sieveshell:
  - added 'edit', which may create scripts, too. (posix only)
  - now prints out the server capabilities, thus the user knows what
    the server is capable of (and which Sieve-Commands may be used).
  - fixed some minor bugs


Version 0.2
----------------------------

Author: Hartmut Goebel <h.goebel@crazy-compilers.com>

- renamed to 'managesieve'
- added sieveshell
- major overhaul
- added support for HAVESPACE, CAPABILITY
- added unittest testsuite (covers most cases)

----------------------------

Author: Ulrich Eck <ueck at net-labs.de>

- initial release of Sieve.py by Ulrich Eck as part of 'ImapClient'
  (see http://www.zope.org/Members/jack-e/ImapClient), a Zope product.
