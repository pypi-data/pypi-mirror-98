# Phunspell

A pure Python spell checker utilizing [spylls](https://github.com/zverok/spylls) a port of [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/).

*NOTE: If you are only supporting languages: English, Russian or Swedish then use [spylls](https://github.com/zverok/spylls) directly: (`pip install spylls`)*

This library includes [dictionaries](https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries) for all languages supported by [LibreOffice](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Dictionaries).

Just a note giving credit where it's due, [spylls](https://github.com/zverok/spylls) is a fantastic project which deserves all the credit. There is a [corresponding blog](https://zverok.github.io/blog/2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html) entry which is a good read. (and of course [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/) itself)

### Usage

    import phunspell

    pspell = phunspell.Phunspell('en_US')
    print(pspell.lookup("phunspell")) # False
    print(pspell.lookup("about")) # True

    mispelled = pspell.lookup_list("Bill's TV is borken".split(" "))
    print(mispelled) # ["borken"]

    for suggestion in pspell.suggest('phunspell'):
        print(suggestion) # Hunspell

### Installation

```shell
pip install phunspell
```

#### Tests
```shell
python -m unittest discover -s phunspell/tests -p "test_*.py"
```

#### Experimental

```python

    # Extended Optional:

    # First time usage:
    # create a directory of dictionaries stored as object
    # makes loading/access much faster

    storage_path = "/home/dvwright/data/phunspell/dictionary_objects"
    # run once only:
    pspell_object_create = PhunspellObjectStore(path=storage_path)


    # Then, typical usage:
    pspell = Phunspell(object_storage=storage_path)

    dicts_words = {
        "an_ES": "vengar",
        "be_BY": "ідалапаклонніцкі",
        "bg_BG": "удържехме",
    }

    for loc in dicts_words.keys():
        print(pspell.lookup(dicts_words[loc], locs=loc))
```

There is an option to build/store all the dictionaries as pickled data. Since there are security risks associated with pickled data we will not include that data in the distrubution.

To create your own local pickled dictionaries:

enter a python shell:
```python
$ python
storage_path = "/home/dvwright/data/phunspell/dictionary_objects"
pspell = PhunspellObjectStore(path=storage_path)
```

*NOTE: You only have to do this once before using the library and it's optional (this will consume a lot of resources!)*

Once completed you should have a picked object for every dictionary supported by this lib.

```shell
$ ls /home/dwright/python/phunspell/pickled_data/
af_ZA
an_ES
be_BY
bg_BG
bn_BD
br_FR
bs_BA
cs_CZ
da_DK
de_AT
de_CH
...
...
...
```

*NOTE: will take up almost 2 GB of space*

```shell
$ du -sh .
1.4G
```

For all future uses of the library just pass the directory as an argument.

```python
storage_path = "/home/dvwright/data/phunspell/dictionary_objects"
pspell = Phunspell(object_storage=storage_path)

# load the specific locale on lookups
pspell.lookup_list(['us-word1', 'us-word2'], locs='en_US')
pspell.lookup('german-word', locs='de_DE')

```

*NOTE: If you ever update dictionary data, you will need to create a new pickle store for it.*

and it should find the dictionaries and load them quickly
