Description: # IFS_explorer
        _A python3 visualization tool for integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data_
        ### Installation
        To install the IFS_explorer package:
        ```
        pip install IFS_explorer
        ```
        or:
        ```
        pip3 install IFS_explorer
        ```
        (depending on the version)
        
        Once installed, run in any terminal:
        ```
        python IFS_widget.py 
        ```
        Other class avaible is rss2cube, class to convert a FITS image of two dimensions and their correspond position table in a 3D cube.  
        For example:
        ```
        from IFS_Explorer import *
        cubo = rss2cube(n_file="C:\\Users\\hp\\Desktop\\cubes\\IRAS06295.fits")
        cubo.create_cube(flag_rotate=1)
        cubo.create_cube(flag_rotate=0)
        ```
        In the case that the user are in a operative system with Linux distribution:
        ```
        from IFS_Explorer import *
        cubo = rss2cube(n_file="C:/Users/hp/Desktop/cubes/IRAS06295.fits")
        cubo.create_cube(flag_rotate=1)
        cubo.create_cube(flag_rotate=0)
        ```
        Whith the conditions:  
        - The FITS image should be of two dimensions.
        - The position table should have the same name that the FITS image with extension: name.pt.txt
        - The FITS image and the position table should be in the same path.
        - The user should specific the flag_rotate with value 0 or 1. The more comun case is 0.
        - The method create_cube() create a new FITS image, when the flag_rotate are 0:  
        ```
        name.rscube.fits
        ```
        - When the flag_rotate are 1:
        ```
        name.rscube_rotate.fits
        ```
        ### Description
        The class of IFS_Explorer displays one windows with the next panels: 
        - The file explorer to select a file to run with the program,the fits files should have projection of RA and DEC or degrees and accept FITS files with extensions:
        ```
        - .fits
        - .fits.gz
        ```
        - Two panels to show the name of the object and the state of the explorer (on, off, select a spaxel for be the center of the integrated region and show the integrated spectrum)
        - Text area to show messsages of the program like the dimensions of the cube, filters used, instruccions, errors, etc.
        - The area for extract region have entry for the radius, button for draw the circle, buttons for create files when previusly drew the circle and show the integrated spectrum of the spaxels inside the circle,the functions permit create three files:
        ```
        Extracted FITS:  
        NAMEFITS_rscube_circle_centerx_centery.fits (Extracted FITS of the selected spaxels)
        Integrated ASCII:  
        NAMEFITS.spectrum_centerx_centery.txt (Integrated spectrum in ASCII format)
        Espectrum FITS:  
        NAMEFITS.spectrum_centerx_centery.fits (Integrated spectrum in FITS format)
        ```
        - Under the area of extract region shows the options to change display axis in projections in RA-DEC and offsets and the area for mark wavelength in the format of numbers separated  by a coma and the function to reset the marks.  
        Example:  400,500  
        With the conditions:  
        minimum value of the array lambda <= x <= maximum value of the array lambda
        - The area of display content the functions to change the Color map (or invert it) of the image FITS and change the Filter.
        - The area to change axis x (Wavelength) and y(Flux) of the spectrum graph, with the next conditions:  
        For flux range:  
        minimum value < maximum value  
        Negative values are accepted.  
        For Wavelength range:  
        minimum value of array lambda <= minimum value < maximum value <= maximum value of array lambda  
        Negative values are not accepted.
        - The area to show the information about the spaxel, if the WCS information is included in the FITS header it shows the coordinates of the spaxel in sexagesimal and degree units. For example:
        ```
        Spaxel             ID                 RA                        DEC 
        [ 46 , 23 ]       1794        12 h  41 m  52.596600 s      41 d 16 m 15.005 s  
        
          RA-deg         DEC-deg
         190.469         41.2708
        ```
        - And if not included:
        ```
           Spaxel          ID
        [ 46 , 23 ]       1794
        ```
        - The area to change value of the band used for the filter, this could be change directly get the number or moving the scale bar, they have one condition:  
        minimum value of array lambda <= band <= maximum value of array lambda  
        This function affect the spectrum graph and the image.
        - For last the area to the spectrum graph and the area for display the FITS image.  
        The area of the image change the spectrum graph depending on what spaxel the mouse is on, or if the explorer is enabled.  
        The spectrum graph show the array lambda on the x axis and the information about the spaxel of the cube in the y axis
