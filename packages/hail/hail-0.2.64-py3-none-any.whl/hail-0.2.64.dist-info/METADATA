[Hail](https://hail.is) is an open-source, general-purpose, Python-based data analysis tool with additional data types and methods for working with genomic data.

Hail is built to scale and has first-class support for multi-dimensional structured data, like the genomic data in a genome-wide association study (GWAS).

Hail is exposed as a Python library, using primitives for distributed queries and linear algebra implemented in Scala, [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html), and increasingly C++.

See the [documentation](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/) for more info on using Hail.

### Community

Hail has been widely adopted in academia and industry, including as the analysis platform for the [genome aggregation database](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) and [UK Biobank rapid GWAS](https://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank). Learn more about [Hail-powered science](https://hail.is/references.html).

### Contribute

If you'd like to discuss or contribute to the development of methods or infrastructure, please:

- see the [For Software Developers](https://hail.is/docs/0.2/getting_started_developing.html) section of the installation guide for info on compiling Hail
- chat with us about development in our [Zulip chatroom](https://hail.zulipchat.com)
- visit the [Development Forum](https://dev.hail.is) for longer-form discussions
<!--- - read [this post]() (coming soon!) for tips on submitting a successful Pull Request to our repository --->

Hail uses a continuous deployment approach to software development, which means we frequently add new features. We update users about changes to Hail via the [Discussion Forum](https://discuss.hail.is). We recommend creating an account on the Discussion Forum so that you can subscribe to these updates as well.

### Maintainer

Hail is maintained by a team in the [Neale lab](https://nealelab.is/) at the [Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research](https://www.broadinstitute.org/stanley) of the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org) and the [Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit](https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/) of [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/).

### Citing Hail

If you use Hail for published work, please cite the software. You can get a
citation for the version of Hail you installed by executing:

```python
import hail as hl
print(hl.citation())
```

Which will look like:
