-------------------

You can view the `3.3.0 milestone`_ on GitLab for more details.

- Add support for Python 3.6 (via dependencies). **Note** Flake8 does not
  guarantee that all plugins will support Python 3.6.

- Display the local file path instead of the temporary file path when
  using the git hook. (See also `GitLab#244`_)

- Add methods to Report class that will be called when Flake8 starts and
  finishes processing a file. (See also `GitLab#251`_)

- Fix problem where hooks should only check \*.py files. (See also
  `GitLab#268`_)

- Fix handling of SyntaxErrors that do not include physical line information.
  (See also `GitLab#279`_)

- Update upper bound on PyFlakes to allow for PyFlakes 1.5.0.  (See also
