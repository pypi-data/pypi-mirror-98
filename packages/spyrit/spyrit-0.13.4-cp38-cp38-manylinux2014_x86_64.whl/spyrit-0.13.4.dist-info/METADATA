# Spyrit Version 0.1

Spyrit Toolbox aims to provide all the necessary tools for single-pixel imaging. Starting from simulation, reconstruction, and interface with DMD and spectrometers.
The aim of this toolbox is to cover all aspects of single-pixel imaging : from simulation to experimental, we aim to provide tools to make realistic measurements and provide reconstruction algorithms. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Under Linux
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/openspyrit/spyrit.git
```

### Prerequisites

All the necessary packages and libraries are contained within the ```setup.py ``` file.

- numpy (>1.3.0)',
- matplotlib (>2.2.4)',
- scipy (>1.1.0)',
- torch (>1.1.0)',
- torchvision (>0.2.2)',
- PIL (>5.3.0)',
- cv2 (>4.0.0)',
- imutils (>0.5.3)',
- pywt (>1.0.1)',
- fht=['https://github.com/nbarbey/fht'] (included as a submodule in spyrit/fht),


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
python3 setup.py
```

To check that the installation has been a success, try running the following lines in yout python terminal :


```
import spyrit
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

```
import torch;
a = torch.randn(64,64);
```


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
