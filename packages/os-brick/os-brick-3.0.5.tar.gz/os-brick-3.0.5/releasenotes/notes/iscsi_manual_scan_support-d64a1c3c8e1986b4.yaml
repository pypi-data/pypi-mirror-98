    Support for setting the scan mode on the Open-iSCSI initiator.  If
    installed iscsiadm supports this feature OS-Brick will set all it's new
    sessions to manual scan.

    unwanted devices polluting our system due to the automatic initiator scan
    or to AEN/AER messages from the backend.
