features:
  - |
    New parameters on `disconnect_volume` named `force` and `ignore_errors` can
    be used to let OS-Brick know that data loss is secondary to leaving a clean
    system with no leftover devices.  If `force` is not set, or set to False,
    preventing data loss will take priority.  Currently only iSCSI implements
    these new parameters.
fixes:
  - |
    iSCSI disconnect refactoring improves reliability, speed, and thoroughness
    on leaving a cleaner system after disconnection.
