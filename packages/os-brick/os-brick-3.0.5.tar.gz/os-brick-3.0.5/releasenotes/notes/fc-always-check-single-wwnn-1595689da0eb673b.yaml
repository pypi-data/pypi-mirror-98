    Always check if we are dealing with a single WWNN Fibre Channel target,
    even when we receive an initiator_target_map.
    This allows us to exclude unconnected HBAs from our scan for storage arrays
    that automatically connect all target ports (due to their architecture and
    design) even if the Cinder driver returns the initiator_target_map,
    provided the target has a single WWNN.
    Excluding these HBAs prevents undesired volumes from being connected.
