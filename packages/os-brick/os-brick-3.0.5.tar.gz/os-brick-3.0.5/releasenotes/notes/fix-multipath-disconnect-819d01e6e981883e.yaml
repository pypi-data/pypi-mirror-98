    Under certain conditions detaching a multipath device may result in
    failure when flushing one of the individual paths, but the disconnect
    should have succeeded, because there were other paths available to flush
    all the data.

    The multipath disconnect mechanism is now more robust and will only fail
    when disconnecting if multipath would lose data.
