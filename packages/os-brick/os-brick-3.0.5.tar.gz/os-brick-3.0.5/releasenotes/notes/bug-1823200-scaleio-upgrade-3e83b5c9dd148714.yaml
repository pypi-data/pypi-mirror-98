    `Bug #1823200 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1823200>`_:
    Prior fixes for this bug changed the connection properties but did
    not take into account an upgrade scenario in which currently attached
    volumes had the old format connection properties and could fail on
    detatch with "KeyError: 'config_group'".  This release updates the
    'scaleio' connector to handle this situation.  It is only applicable
    to deployments using a Dell EMC PowerFlex/VxFlex OS/ScaleIO backend.
