ACCIM stands for Adaptive Comfort Control Implemented Model.

In research terms, this is a proposal for a paradigm shift, from using fixed PMV-based to adaptive setpoint temperatures, based on adaptive thermal comfort algorithms and it has been widely studied and published on scientific research journals (for more information, refer to https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3080-0821).

In terms of code, this is a python package that transforms fixed setpoint temperature building energy models into adaptive setpoint temperature energy models by adding the Adaptive Comfort Control Implementation Script (ACCIS). This package has been developed to be used in EnergyPlus building energy performance simulations.

### Credits

It wouldn't have been possible to develop this python package without eppy, so thank you for such an awesome work.
