Description: The **kodi-nfo-generator** is a simple Python-based command-line
        tool that allows you to generate `.nfo <https://kodi.wiki/view/NFO_files/Movies>`_ 
        files for movies that `Kodi <https://kodi.tv/>`_ can use for its library.
        
        This tool is aimed at people that manually curate their movie databases, in order
        to avoid using scrapers that may pull in the wrong information (or none at all).
        All the user has to do is place an ID file alongside their movie files,
        the default is `*.imdb`, containing the unique IMDB movie ID (or full IMDB movie URL).
        The tool will then scour the movie directories for these files and pull in the
        information and create the `.nfo` files in the same location.
