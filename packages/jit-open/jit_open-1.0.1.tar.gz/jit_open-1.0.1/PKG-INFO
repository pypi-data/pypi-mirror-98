Description: Just in time open files.
        ========================
        
        This package provides a way to delay opening files until the something is
        written to the file handle. This can be convenient when opening a large number
        of files of which most of them will not be frequently used. To deal with
        resource limits a queue is used from which, when full, the least frequent file
        is closed.
