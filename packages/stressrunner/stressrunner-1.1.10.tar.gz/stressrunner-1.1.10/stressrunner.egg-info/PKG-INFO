        # Install
        ```shell script
        pip install stressrunner -U
        ```
        
        # Quick Start:
        A TestRunner for use with the Python unit testing framework. It
        generates a HTML report to show the result at a glance.
        The simplest way to use this is to invoke its main method. E.g.
        ```python
        from stressrunner import runner
        # define your tests
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            runner.main()
        ```
        For more customization options, instantiates a StressRunner object.
        StressRunner is a counterpart to unittest's TextTestRunner. E.g.
        ```python
        # output to a file
        from stressrunner import StressRunner
        
        runner = StressRunner(
            report_path='./report/test.html',
            test_title='My unit test',
            desc='This demonstrates the report output by StressRunner.'
        )
        ```
