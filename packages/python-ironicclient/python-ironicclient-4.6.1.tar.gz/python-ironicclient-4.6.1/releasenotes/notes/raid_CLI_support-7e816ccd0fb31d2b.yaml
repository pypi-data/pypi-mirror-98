    Adds support for RAID configuration:

    * Ability to set target_raid_config for a node using
      node-set-target-raid-config.

    * Displays target_raid_config and raid_config in
      node-show.

    * Displays logical disk properties for a driver using
      driver-raid-logical-disk-properties.

    API version 1.15 should be used with these features, as
    RAID configuration was added in 1.12 and manual cleaning
    (used to trigger RAID configuration) was added in 1.15.
