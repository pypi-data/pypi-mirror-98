    These previously deprecated commands were removed and are no longer
    available:

    * ``openstack baremetal delete``
    * ``openstack baremetal list``
    * ``openstack baremetal show``
    * ``openstack baremetal set``
    * ``openstack baremetal unset``

    Instead, use these corresponding equivalent commands:

    * ``openstack baremetal node delete``
    * ``openstack baremetal node list``
    * ``openstack baremetal node show``
    * ``openstack baremetal node set``
    * ``openstack baremetal node unset``

    Support for creating a single node via ``openstack baremetal create`` had
    been previously deprecated; it is now no longer available.
    Instead, use the equivalent command ``openstack baremetal node
    create``.  The only valid usage of ``openstack baremetal create`` is to
    create various resources (chassis, nodes, port groups, and ports) from
    resource files.
