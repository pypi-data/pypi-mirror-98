    Extend the OpenStackClient plugin with new commands:

    * openstack baremetal port group create
    * openstack baremetal port group show
    * openstack baremetal port group list
    * openstack baremetal port group delete
    * openstack baremetal port group set
    * openstack baremetal port group unset

    Extends the 'openstack baremetal port' commands
    (where applicable) to allow specifying the port group
    (if any) that a port is a member of, via the new --port-group
    argument.
