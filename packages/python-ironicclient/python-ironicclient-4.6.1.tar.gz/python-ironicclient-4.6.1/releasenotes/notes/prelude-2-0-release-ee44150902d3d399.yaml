    The 2.0 release has three major changes:

    * The default API version for the ``openstack baremetal`` and
      ``ironic`` commands changed from ``1.9`` to ``latest``. ``latest``
      is the maximum version understood by both the client and the server.
      This change makes the CLI automatically pull in new features
      and changes (including potentially breaking), from servers.

    * The ``python-ironicclient`` package no longer includes the
      ``python-openstackclient`` (OSC) package as a requirement.
      ``python-openstackclient`` is needed if using the
      ``openstack baremetal`` CLI.

    * The ``ironic`` command line interface (``ironic`` commands) is
      deprecated and will be removed in the OpenStack S* release.
      Please use the ``openstack baremetal`` CLI instead.
