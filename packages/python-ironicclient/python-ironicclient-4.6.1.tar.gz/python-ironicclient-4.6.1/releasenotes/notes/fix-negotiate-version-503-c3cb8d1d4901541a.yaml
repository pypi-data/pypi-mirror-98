    Fixes an issue where some failure modes of communication with the Ironic
    API could result in an exception that circumvents the client's retry
    mechanisms. In particular this includes HTTP 503 service unavailable which
    is seen when Ironic operates behind a load balancer, and no backend is
    available to handle the request.
