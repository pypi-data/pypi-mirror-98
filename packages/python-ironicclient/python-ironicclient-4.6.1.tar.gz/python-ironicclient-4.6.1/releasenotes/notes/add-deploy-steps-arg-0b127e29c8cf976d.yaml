    Adds support for providing optional deploy steps when deploying or
    rebuilding; available with ironic-api-version 1.69 or higher. Baremetal CLI
    is ``baremetal node <provision-state> <node> --deploy-steps
    <deploy-steps>`` where ``<provision-state>`` is 'deploy' or 'rebuild' and
    ``<deploy-steps>`` are deploy steps in JSON format. May be path to a file
    containing deploy steps; OR '-', with the deploy steps being read from
    standard input; OR a string. The value should be a list of deploy-step
    dictionaries; each dictionary should have keys 'interface', 'step' and
    'priority', and optional key 'args'. When overlapping, these steps override
    deploy template and driver steps. For more information see
    `Deploy Steps in Node Deployment documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/node-deployment.html#id3>`_.
