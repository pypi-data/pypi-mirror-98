features:
  - Adds the ``openstack baremetal driver raid property list <driver>``
    command. For a specified driver, this returns a list of the
    RAID logical disk properties that can be specified, along with
    a description for each property. (The values of these properties
    are specified in a node's ``target_raid_config`` field.)
