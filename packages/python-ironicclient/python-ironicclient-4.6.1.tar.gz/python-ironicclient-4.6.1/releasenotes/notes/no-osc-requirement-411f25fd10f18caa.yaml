    ``python-ironicclient`` package no longer has
    the ``python-openstackclient`` package (OSC) as a requirement.

    Users installing only the ``python-ironicclient`` package will not
    automatically get access to ``openstack baremetal ...`` OSC commands.
    To have them available, the ``python-openstackclient`` package must
    be installed separately, or, when installing ``python-ironicclient``
    via ``pip``, the new ``cli`` extra can be used to also install OSC:

    .. code-block:: shell

       pip install python-ironicclient[cli]
