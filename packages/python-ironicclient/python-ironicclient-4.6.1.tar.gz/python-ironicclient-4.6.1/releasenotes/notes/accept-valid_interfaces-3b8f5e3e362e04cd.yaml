    The consumer of ironicclient may be deriving their ``get_client`` kwargs
    from config inherited from ksa, where the ``interface`` option has been
    deprecated in favor of ``valid_interfaces``. To accomodate this, we now
    accept ``valid_interfaces`` as a kwarg, giving it precedence over
    ``interface``. However, we still accept ``interface``, as the consumer may
    be deriving kwargs from a non-conf source (such as an already-created ksa
    Adapter where ``valid_interfaces`` has already been translated to
    ``interfaces``).
