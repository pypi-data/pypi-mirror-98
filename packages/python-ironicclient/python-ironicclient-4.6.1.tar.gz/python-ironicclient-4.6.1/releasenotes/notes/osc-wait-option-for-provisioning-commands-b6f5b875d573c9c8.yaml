    Adds an option ``--wait [<time-out>]`` to all  of the
    OSC provisioning commands, except for abort which is not
    supported. When specified, provisioning commands will
    wait for the node to reach the desired state before
    returning. An optional argument, time-out, can be specified
    which will end the waiting after the specified amount of
    time (in seconds). The default value for this timeout is
    0, which means it will wait indefinitely.
