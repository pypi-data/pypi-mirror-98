features:
  - Adds a new ``ironic create`` command that creates resources (chassis,
    nodes, ports) specified in one or more JSON (``*.json``) or YAML
    (``*.yaml``) files.
  - Adds a new ``openstack baremetal create`` command. Similar to the ``ironic
    create`` command, this command creates resources specified in one or more
    files. (Note that ``openstack baremetal create`` can also be used to create
    a node via specified node attributes. However, this feature has been
    deprecated since 1.4.0.)
