features:
  - |
    Allows a python API user to pass ``latest`` to the client creation request
    for the ``os_ironic_api_version`` parameter. The version utilized for REST
    API requests will, as a result, be the highest available version
    understood by both the ironicclient library and the server.
  - |
    Adds base client properties to provide insight to a python API user of
    what the current REST API version that will be utilized, and if API
    version negotiation has occured.
    These new properties are ``client.current_api_version`` and
    ``client.is_api_version_negotiated`` respectively.
  - |
    Adds additional base client method to allow a python API user to trigger
    version negotiation and return the negotiated version. This new method is
    ``client.negotiate_api_version()``.
other:
  - |
    The maximum supported version supported for negotiation is now defined
    in the ``common/http.py`` file. Any new feature added to the API client
    library must increment this version.
  - |
    The maximum known version supported by the ``OpenStackClient`` plugin is
    now defined by the maximum supported version for API negotiation as
    defined in the ``common/http.py`` file.
