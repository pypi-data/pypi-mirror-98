    Adds new family of arguments to the ``openstack baremetal node set``
    command: ``--reset-XXX-interface``, where ``XXX`` is a name of a hardware
    interface. This argument resets the node's ``XXX_interface`` field to its
    calculated default (based on the node's hardware type and the
    configuration).
