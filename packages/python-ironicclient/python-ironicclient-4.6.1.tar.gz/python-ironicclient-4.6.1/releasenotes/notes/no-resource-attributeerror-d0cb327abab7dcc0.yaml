fixes:
  - For node resources that had no boot devices, no supported boot devices, or
    no passthru methods (and driver resources with no properties or no passthru
    methods), issuing a request to get that information (for example,
    'ironic driver-get-vendor-passthru-methods fake') would result in the
    error "'NoneType' has no attribute 'to_dict'". This is fixed; an empty
    list is now returned.
