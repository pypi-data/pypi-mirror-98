    Adds the ability to set and unset the ``retired`` and
    ``retired_reason`` with API 1.61. Setting the ``retired``
    field on a node excludes it from scheduling, but still
    allows the node to be cleaned (unlike maintenance, for
    instance). The fields can be set irrespective of the
    node's state and are meant to be used to prepare nodes
    for removal from ironic.
