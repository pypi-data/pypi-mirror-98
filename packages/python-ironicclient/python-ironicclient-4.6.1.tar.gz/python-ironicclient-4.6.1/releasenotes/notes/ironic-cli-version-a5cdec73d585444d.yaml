upgrade:
  - |
    The default API version for the ``ironic`` command changed from ``1.9``
    to ``latest``. ``latest`` is the maximum version understood by both
    the client and the server.
    This change makes the CLI automatically pull in new features and changes
    (including potentially breaking), when talking to new servers.

    Scripts that used the previous default API version, or that rely on
    some specific API behavior, should set the
    ``IRONIC_API_VERSION`` environment variable or use the
    ``--ironic-api-version`` CLI argument.

    .. note:: This change does not affect the Python API.
features:
  - |
    The ``ironic`` command now supports the specification of API version ``1``.
    The actual version used will be the maximum 1.x version understood by both
    the client and the server.  Thus, it is currently identical to the
    ``latest`` value.
fixes:
  - |
    Users of the ``ironic`` command no longer have to specify an explicit
    API version to use the latest features. The default API version changed
    from ``1.9`` to ``latest``, which is the maximum version understood by
    both the client and the server.
