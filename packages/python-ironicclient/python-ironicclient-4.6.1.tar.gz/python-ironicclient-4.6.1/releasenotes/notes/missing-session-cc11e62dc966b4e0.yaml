    Fixes a confusing error message when a session is not provided for
    ``ironicclient.v1.client.Client``.
  - |
    With the removal of the ``HTTPClient`` class in the release 3.0.0, it is
    now mandatory to pass a session into ``ironicclient.v1.client.Client``.
    The helper call ``ironicclient.client.get_client`` can also be used to
    construct a session implicitly.
