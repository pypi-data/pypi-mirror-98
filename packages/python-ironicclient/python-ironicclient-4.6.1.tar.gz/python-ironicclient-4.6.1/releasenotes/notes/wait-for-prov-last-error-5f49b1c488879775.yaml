    Waiting for a provision state to be reached (via CLI ``--wait`` argument or
    the ``wait_for_provision_state`` function) no longer aborts when the node's
    ``last_error`` field gets populated. It can cause a normal deployment to
    abort if a heartbeat from the ramdisk fails because of locking - see
    `story 2002094 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002094>`_.
