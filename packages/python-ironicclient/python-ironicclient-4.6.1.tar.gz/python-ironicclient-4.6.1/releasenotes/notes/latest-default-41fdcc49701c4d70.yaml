upgrade:
  - |
    The default API version for the bare metal OSC client (``openstack
    baremetal`` commands) changed from ``1.9`` to ``latest``. ``latest``
    is the maximum version understood by both the client and the server.
    This change makes the CLI
    automatically pull in new features and changes (including potentially
    breaking), when talking to new servers.

    Scripts that used the previous default API version, or that rely on
    some specific API behavior, should set the
    ``OS_BAREMETAL_API_VERSION`` environment variable or use the
    ``--os-baremetal-api-version`` CLI argument.

    .. note:: This change does not affect the Python API.
features:
  - |
    The bare metal OSC client (``openstack baremetal`` commands) now supports
    the specification of API version ``1``. The actual version used will be
    the maximum 1.x version understood by both the client and the server.
    Thus, it is currently identical to the ``latest`` value.
fixes:
  - |
    Users of the ``openstack baremetal`` commands no longer have to specify
    an explicit API version to use the latest features. The default API version
    changed from ``1.9`` to ``latest``, which is the maximum version
    understood by both the client and the server.
