    Replaces ``openstack baremetal node power <on|off>`` with
    the two commands:

    * ``openstack baremetal node power on`` and
    * ``openstack baremetal node power off``.

    There is no change to the command the user enters (the actual
    command line is the same). However, help (e.g. via
    ``openstack -h baremetal``) will list the two power commands
    (instead of the original one).
