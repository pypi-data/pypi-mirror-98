    Adds support for ``NodeManager.set_provision_state``,
    ``NodeManager.update``, ``NodeManager.get``, and ``NodeManager.list``
    to accept an ``os_ironic_api_version`` keyword argument to override
    the API version for that specific call to the REST API.

    When overridden, the API version is not preserved, and if an unsupported
    version is requested from the remote API, an ``UnsupportedVersion``
    exception is raised.
