## PRIVATE CALDAV SERVER(S) TO RUN TESTS TOWARDS
## Make a list of your own servers/accounts that you'd like to run the
## test towards.  Running the test suite towards a personal account
## should generally be safe, it should not mess up with content there
## and it should clean up after itself, but don't sue me if anything
## goes wrong ...

## servers from conf.py.  As of 2020-10 no public test servers exists, so this option
## is currently moot :-(

## test_private_test_servers - test using the list configured above in this file.

## written in python and can be instantiated quite easily, those will
## be the default caldav implementation to test towards.
