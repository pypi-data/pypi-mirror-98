## Fixups to the icalendar data to work around compatbility issues.

## TODO:

## 1) this should only be done if needed.  Use try-except around the
## fragments where icalendar/vobject is parsing ical data, and do the
## fixups there.

## 2) arguably, this is outside the scope of the caldav library.
## check if this can be done in vobject or icalendar libraries instead
## of here

## TODO: would be nice with proper documentation on what systems are
## generating broken data.  Compatibility issues should also be collected
## in the documentation. somewhere.
def fix(event):
    """This function receives some ical as it's given from the server, checks for 
    breakages with the standard, and attempts to fix up known issues:

    1) COMPLETED MUST be a datetime in UTC according to the RFC, but sometimes 
    a date is given. (Google Calendar?)

    2) The RFC does not specify any range restrictions on the dates,
    but clearly it doesn't make sense with a CREATED-timestamp that is
    centuries or decades before RFC2445 was published in 1998.
    Apparently some calendar servers generate nonsensical CREATED
    timestamps while other calendar servers can't handle CREATED
    timestamps prior to 1970.  Probably it would make more sense to
    drop the CREATED line completely rather than moving it from the
    end of year 0AD to the beginning of year 1970. (Google Calendar)

    3) iCloud apparently duplicates the DTSTAMP property sometimes -
    keep the first DTSTAMP encountered (arguably the DTSTAMP with earliest value
    should be kept).
