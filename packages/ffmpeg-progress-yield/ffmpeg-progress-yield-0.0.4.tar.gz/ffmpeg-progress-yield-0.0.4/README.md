## Requirements

-   Python 3.6 or higher
-   ffmpeg v3.1 or above from <http://ffmpeg.org/> installed in your \$PATH

## Installation

    pip3 install ffmpeg-progress-yield

Or download this repository, then run `pip install .`.

## Usage

In your Python project, import the helper class and run `run_command_with_progress`:

```python
from ffmpeg_progress_yield import FfmpegProgress

cmd = [
    "ffmpeg", "-i", "test/test.mp4", "-c:v", "libx264", "-vf", "scale=1920x1080", "-preset", "fast", "-f", "null", "/dev/null",
]

ff = FfmpegProgress(cmd)
for progress in ff.run_command_with_progress():
    print(f"{progress}/100")
```

The command will yield the current progress in percent.

If you have `tqdm` installed, you can create a fancy progress bar:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
from ffmpeg_progress_yield import FfmpegProgress

cmd = [
    "ffmpeg", "-i", "test/test.mp4", "-c:v", "libx264", "-vf", "scale=1920x1080", "-preset", "fast", "-f", "null", "/dev/null",
]

ff = FfmpegProgress(cmd)
with tqdm(total=100, position=1, desc="Test") as pbar:
    for progress in ff.run_command_with_progress():
        pbar.update(progress - pbar.n)
```

You can get the output of the command with the `.stderr` attribute of the `FfmpegProgress` class.

## Caveats

Some notes:

1. The progress cannot be extracted for sources that don't have a duration (e.g. live sources).

2. Currently, we do not differentiate between `stderr` and `stdout`. This means progress will be mixed with the ffmpeg log.

You can also check out [`ffmpeg-progress`](https://github.com/Tatsh/ffmpeg-progress) for a similar project with a different feature set.
