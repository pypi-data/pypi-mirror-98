    Upon adding an IP address to the allowed_address_pairs field of a
    Neutron's port, networking-ovn will look if that IP address matches
    with the IP of an existing port in the same network and set its
    type to "virtual" (if it does match). By doing that, networking-ovn
    tells OVN that this virtual port is not bound to any VIF (required
    for VRRP configuration).
