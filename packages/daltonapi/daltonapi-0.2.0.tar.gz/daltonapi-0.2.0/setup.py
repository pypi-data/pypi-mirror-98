Currently, `get_assets` accepts owner, template, schema, and/or collection as either strings or Class Objects. \n```\n>>> # Get assets using owner and template as strings\n>>> assets = atom.get_assets(owner="someowner123", template = "12345")\n>>>\n>>> # Get assets using collection class object\n>>> assets = atom.get_assets(collection=my_asset.collection)\n```\n\n## Documentation\nFull documentation is being assembled at [Read the Docs](https://dalton.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n\n## Contributing\nSee [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nAlternatively, if you would like to sponsor me, consider donating some WAX to the address `daltonpython`.\n![https://i.imgur.com/rWbgGW3.png](https://i.imgur.com/rWbgGW3.png)\n\n\n## Attribution\n* [WAX team](https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange) for development of the WAX blockchain.\n* [Pink.network](https://github.com/pinknetworkx) for development of atomic assets.\n* [PurpleBooth](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth) for Contributing Template.\n\n## Contact me\n* Twitter: [@stuckat6pm](https://twitter.com/stuckat6pm)',
