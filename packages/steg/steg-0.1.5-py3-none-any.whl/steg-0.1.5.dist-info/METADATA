```
# Import library
from steg import steg_img

# Hiding
# Select your payload and carrier files
s = steg_img.IMG(payload_path=<payload path>, image_path=<carrier path>)
# Create a new image containing your payload
s.hide()

# Extracting
# Select the carrier image
s_prime = steg_img.IMG(image_path=<path of containing hidden payload>)
# Extract the payload
s_prime.extract()
```
## Commandline Usage

```$ steg -c <your image file> -p <your payload>```
2. To extract a payload from a carrier:
```$ steg -c <your image file>```
