# Report output

The report generated by PRESC is built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).
Report source is maintained under
[`presc/report/resources`](../presc/report/resources).

An example of how to run the report using the Python API
can be found in the
[`sample_report.py`](../examples/report/sample_report.py)
script.
