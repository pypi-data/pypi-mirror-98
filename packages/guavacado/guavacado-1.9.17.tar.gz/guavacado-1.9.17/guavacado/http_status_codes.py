# creates dictionary of http status numbers, indicating the name of the status code
# status codes taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes



# All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes (or categories). The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any class or categorization role. There are five values for the first digit:
# * 1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process
# * 2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood and accepted
# * 3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
# * 4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
# * 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

http_status_info = {
	# ==1xx Informational response==
	# An informational response indicates that the request was received and understood. It is issued on a provisional basis while request processing continues. It alerts the client to wait for a final response. The message consists only of the status line and optional header fields, and is terminated by an empty line. As the HTTP/1.0 standard did not define any 1xx status codes, servers ''must not''<ref group="note">Italicised words and phrases such as ''must'' and ''should'' represent interpretation guidelines as given by RFC 2119</ref> send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 compliant client except under experimental conditions.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Status Code Definitions|url=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html|website=W3|accessdate=16 October 2015}}</ref>

To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send <code>Expect: 100-continue</code> as a header in its initial request and receive a <code>100 Continue</code> status code in response before sending the body.
