```
####  1 Choose image bed

When using for the first time, you must first select a image bed. The available image bed list is after the `-c` parameter of **Options**:

- 0
  - sm.ms
- 1
  - imgtu.com
- 2
  - gitee.com
- 3
  - github.com

```shell
# if you want to choose github:
timg -c 3
```
#### 2 Save authentication information

**General image bed:**

The general picture bed refers to the website that only provides the function of saving images, so **git site** is not included.

When using the general image bed, use `-l` or `--login` to configure authentication information:

```shell
timg -l username password
```
**Git site:**

Including gitee and github.

When using a git site, use `-lg` or `--login-git` to configure authentication information.

The authentication information includes the following four key parameters:

- `ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `USERNAME` 
- `REPO` 
- `FOLDER`
  - If the folder does not exist, it will be created automatically

For example, I want to save the image in the `md` folder in the `image-bed` repository, and enter this command:

```shell
timg -lg access_token username image-bed md
```

#### 3 Write the command in typora

Then fill in the command as shown in the figure below.

There is a parameter `-aac` in the command as an optional parameter, which is used to enable the automatic compression function. 

If this parameter is not added, the image will not be automatically compressed when uploading. If the image size exceeds the limit of the image bed, an exception will be thrown during upload.

Adding this parameter will automatically compress images that exceed the limit size to the limit image size or below, ensuring that images can be uploaded smoothly. 

Turn on automatic compression:

```shell
timg -aac -ps
```

Turn off automatic compression:

```shell
timg -ps
```

Configure in `Typora`:

# End

Now, when you add a picture to `Typora`, it will be automatically uploaded to the picture bed.
