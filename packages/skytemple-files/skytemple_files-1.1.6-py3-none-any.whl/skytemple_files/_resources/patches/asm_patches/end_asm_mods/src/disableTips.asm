; This hack disables the tips shown at the start of the game and when interacting with certain items for the first time.
; Since some of the functions used to do this are no longer needed, it also frees up some space that could be used by another patch to store extra
; instructions if needed.
; Freed areas (both adresses inclusive):
; EU: 0x234DAF4 ~ 0x234DB5C (overlay_0029.bin), 0x204D588 ~ 0x204D610 (arm9.bin)
; US: 0x234CEF4 ~ 0x234CF5C (overlay_0029.bin), 0x204D250 ~ 0x204D2D8 (arm9.bin)

; This file is intended to be used with armips v0.11
; Required ROM: Explorers of Sky (EU/US)
; Required files: arm9.bin, overlay_0029.bin
