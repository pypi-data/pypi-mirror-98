# Conductor for 3DS Max

3ds Max plugin submitter for the Conductor Cloud rendering service.

## Install


**To install the latest version.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade ciomax --target=$HOME/Conductor
```

**To install a specific version, for example 0.1.0.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall ciomax==0.1.0 --target=$HOME/Conductor
```

**Setup the Plugin startup file from a command prompt or Powershell on a Windows machine.** 

```bash
python ~/Conductor/ciomax/post_install.py
```

> **NOTE** An alternative is to install from the Plugins page in the [Conductor Companion app](https://docs.conductortech.com/getting_started/installation/#companion-app)


## Usage

To set up a render, go to **Rendering** menu in 3ds Max and choose **Render with Conductor**.

For detailed help, checkout the [tutorial](https://docs.conductortech.com/tutorials/max) and [reference](https://docs.conductortech.com/reference/max) documentation.


## Contributing

> **NOTE:** These instructions were written from the point of view of a developer coding on Mac or Linux, and where 3ds Max on Windows has access to $HOME/ConductorStaging over the network.

Clone the repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:ConductorTechnologies/ciomax.git
cd ciomax
```

Set up a clean virtual envirionment with Python 2.7 for development (optional).

```
python -m virtualenv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install development dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

Build and install from this directory into to a convenient location for testing.
```

pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt --target=$HOME/ConductorStaging

```

When you install from the file requirements.txt, the dependency on ciocore is specified as a local sibling of this project, meaning you can develop ciocore and ciomaya in parallel. If you have no interest in using a dev version of ciocore, then replace `-r requirements.txt` with a dot `.` instead.

As we are working on a different platform, you'll have to tell 3ds Max on Windows where to find the installation. This means you have to create in MaxScript stub file in one of the locations 3ds Max searches for plugins.

Create the following stub file. Te content's must be a location reachable from the Windows machine.

<small>`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Autodesk\3dsMax\2021 - 64bit\ENU\scripts\startup\ciomax_stub.ms`</small>
```
-- Calls the Conductor 3DS Max plugin..
(
  include "Z:\\Mac\\Home\\ConductorStaging\\ciomax\\Conductor.ms"
)

```

> **NOTE** The above file is created automatically for customers when they use the Companion app, as it runs a post_install script.

If you develop natively on Windows, please consider adding your workflow steps to this section.

## Changelog

### Version:0.2.9 -- 16 Mar 2021

* Adds slack to config. [6c09f33]

### Version:0.2.8 -- 12 Mar 2021

* Add .circleci/config.yml. [c922ffe]
* Change output path to something simpler: renders. [46aa00d]

### Version:0.2.5 -- 03 Mar 2021

* Scenes that used Conductor prior to this release should work fine, however, we recommended to delete the **ConductorStore** object and reopen the dialog to get the latest defaults and to avoid unanticipated conflicts.
* Remove sampling flags from default kick command. [28857a0]
* Adds a drop-down menu to choose the render camera. The presubmission scripts then attach this camera to the active view so that the vrscene or ass files use it to render through. [f97866c]
* Changed behavior of the presubmission script `Execute` button. It now runs, and then displays the **Preview** tab to show you how the fully resolved submission object looks. [35f551a]
* Presubmission scripts have a different return type. They now return an object the same shape as a regular submission, which means any fields can be amended during presubmission. A concrete example is adding the `ARNOLD_PATHMAP` variable to the environment. Extra Assets and Environment amendments work, but several fields are yet to be implemented. [d73690c]
* When rendering ass files, we now generate a path remapping file and set the ARNOLD_PATHMAP variable to point to the file on the remote render nodes. This is required to allow the renderer to find windows paths that start with drive letters on the Linux filesystem. ARNOLD_PATHMAP was introduced in Arnold 6.0.4.0 so we now limit the available versions of mtoa to those later than 4.0.4 for compatibility.
* This release adds two new validations.  [dcc77e5]
  1. Ensure either Vray or Artnold are the selected renderer. 
  2. Ensure Legacy 3d Maps Support is off when Arnold is the renderer.
* The `<timestamp>` token now has 1-second granularity as opposed to 1 minute. This helps to reduce conflicts when 2 jobs are submitted close to each other, especially if using an upload daemon. [0e90e9a]
