"""
Python Client API for OpenEO backends. This client is a lightweight implementation with limited dependencies on other modules.
The aim of OpenEO is to process remote sensing data on dedicated processing resources close to the source data.

This client allows users to communicate with OpenEO backends, in a way that feels familiar for Python programmers.

In this example, a 'datacube' is created using `load_collection`. Datacubes can be transformed by applying operations directly.
