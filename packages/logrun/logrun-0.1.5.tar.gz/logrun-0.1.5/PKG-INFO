Description: # `logrun`
        
        A package for experiment logging in Python.
        
        Features include:
        
        - Stores relevant source code (only what is necessary) with the experiments automatically;
        - Easily fetch the experiments that generated a given file;
        - Easily fetch the experiments that were generated by a given script;
        - Shouldn't use tons of storage;
        - Everything runs locally -- no possibly-sketchy third-party will be getting access to your code and experiments.
        
        ## Install
        
        `logrun` can be installed [via `pip`](https://pypi.org/project/logrun/):
        
        ```sh
        pip install logrun
        ```
        
        ## Example usage
        
        The following example trains a model and registers an experiment that outputted the file `trained_model.pth`:
        
        ```python
        from logrun.utils.general import outpath
        import pickle
        
        
        ...  # your experiment, yada yada yada
        model = ...
        ...  # your experiment, yada yada yada
        
        with open(outpath("trained_model.pickle"), 'wb') as file:
            pickle.dump(model, file)
        ```
        
        Note that you only needed to import the module and use the `outpath` function here. Everything else is neatly encapsulated in the `logrun.internals` module.
