        What is PyAMS?
        ==============
        
        PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applications
        and content management with the Pyramid framework.
        
        **PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,
        see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of web
        application.
        
        All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyams.readthedocs.io>`_; source code
        is available on `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/pyams>`_ and pushed to `Github
        <https://github.com/py-ams>`_. Doctests are available in the *doctests* source folder.
        
        
        What is PyAMS workflow?
        =======================
        
        PyAMS_workflow is an extension package for PyAMS, which is used to handle contents workflows.
        This package is based on "hurry.workflow", which was a workflow management package for Zope 3,
        now adapted and extended for Pyramid.
        
        Please note however that this package doesn't provide any management interface, so can probably
        be reused easily outside of Pyramid.
