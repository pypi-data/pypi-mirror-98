## Quick Notification

* New version 1.1.0 is the very different then the previous version ( < 1.0.5) in term of passing hyper-parameters. 
* So please careful check your version before using this library.

* If you guys are familiar with writing documentation and would like to join this project. Please send me an email 
  to nguyenthieu2102@gmail.com. I am currently working on my master thesis, may not response instantly, so please be 
  patient. Your contribution to this project is greatly appreciated. 
  
* If you guys want me to implement new algorithm, please open an [Issues ticket](https://github.com/thieu1995/mealpy/issues), and better send me an PDF of the 
  original paper so I can read and implement it.


## Introduction
* MEALPY is a largest python module for the most of cutting-edge nature-inspired meta-heuristic 
  algorithms (population-based) and is distributed under MIT license. 
  
* But this library for solving single (uni or 1) objective optimization problem only. If you are facing 
  multiple/many objective optimization problems (Finding a Pareto front or reference front) check out my new library 
  "momapy" (A collection of the state-of-the-art Multiple/Many Objective Metaheuristic Algorithms in PYthon). 
  "MOMAPY" will be hosted here: [link](https://github.com/thieu1995/momapy)


* The goals of this framework are:
    * Sharing knowledge of meta-heuristic fields to everyone without a fee
    * Helping other researchers in all field access to optimization algorithms as quickly as possible
    * Implement the classical as well as the state-of-the-art meta-heuristics (The whole history of meta-heuristics, currently including almost 100 algorithms)
    
* What you can do with this library:
    * Analyse parameters of algorithms.
    * Perform Qualitative Analysis of algorithms.
    * Perform Quantitative Analysis of algorithms.
    * Analyse rate of convergence of algorithms.
    * Test the scalability of algorithms.
    * Analyse the stability of algorithms.
    * Analyse the robustness of algorithms.
    
* And please giving me some credit if you are using this library. Lots of people just use it without reference.

## Installation

### Dependencies
* Python (>= 3.6)
* Numpy (>= 1.15.1)
* Opfunu (>= 0.8.0)         
* Matplotlib (>=3.1.3)
* Scipy (>= 1.4.1)


### User installation
Install the [current PyPI release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mealpy):
```code 
    pip install mealpy
    pip install --upgrade mealpy 
```
Or install the development version from GitHub:
```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/thieu1995/mealpy
```

### Example

* Please don't misunderstand between parameters (hyper-parameters) and variables.
* Assumption that you have to find minimum of function F(x) = x1^3 + x2^2 + x3^4 with
  (-1 <= x1 <= 4), (5 <= x2 <= 10) and (-7 <= x2 <= -4). Then
  
  * Your solution is x = [x1, x2, x3], x1, x2, x3 here are the variables.
  * The number of dimension (problem size) = 3 (variables)  
  * Your fitness value is fx = F(x)
  * lower bound and upper bound: lb = [-1, 5, -7] and ub = [4, 10, -4]
  * parameters (hyper-parameters) is depended on each algorithm.
  * objective function here is F(x) for minimize problem.
  
```python 
# Define an objective function, for example above:
def Fx(solution):
  fx = solution[0] ** 3 + solution[1] ** 2 + solution[2] ** 4
  return fx 
```

  
```python

# This is basic example how you can call an optimizer, and its variants. For the version ( MEALPY >= 1.1.0)

from opfunu.cec_basic.cec2014_nobias import *
from mealpy.swarm_based.PSO import BasePSO, PPSO, PSO_W, HPSO_TVA


# Setting parameters
obj_func = F5       # This objective function come from "opfunu" library. You can design your own objective function like above
verbose = False     # Print out the training results
epoch = 500         # Number of iterations / generations / epochs
pop_size = 50       # Populations size (Number of individuals / Number of solutions)

# A - Different way to provide lower bound and upper bound. Here are some examples:

## 1. When you have different lower bound and upper bound for each variables
lb1 = [-3, -5, 1]
ub1 = [5, 10, 100]

md1 = BasePSO(obj_func, lb1, ub1, verbose, epoch, pop_size)
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md1.train()
print(md1.solution[1])

## 2. When you have same lower bound and upper bound for each variables, then you can use:
##      + int or float: then you need to specify your problem size (number of dimensions)
problemSize = 10
lb2 = -5
ub2 = 10
md2 = BasePSO(obj_func, lb2, ub2, verbose, epoch, pop_size, problem_size=problemSize)  # Remember the keyword "problem_size"
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md2.train()
print(md2.solution[1])

##      + array: 2 ways
lb3 = [-5]
ub3 = [10]
md3 = BasePSO(obj_func, lb3, ub3, verbose, epoch, pop_size, problem_size=problemSize)  # Remember the keyword "problem_size"
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md3.train()
print(md3.solution[1])

lb4 = [-5] * problemSize
ub4 = [10] * problemSize
md4 = BasePSO(obj_func, lb4, ub4, verbose, epoch, pop_size)  # No need the keyword "problem_size"
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md4.train()
print(md4.solution[1])

# B - Test with algorithm has batch size idea

## 1. Not using batch size idea

md5 = BasePSO(obj_func, lb4, ub4, verbose, epoch, pop_size)
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md5.train()
print(md1.solution[0])
print(md1.solution[1])
print(md1.loss_train)

## 2. Using batch size idea
batchIdea = True
batchSize = 5

md6 = BasePSO(obj_func, lb4, ub4, verbose, epoch, pop_size, batch_idea=batchIdea, batch_size=batchSize)  # Remember the keywords
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md6.train()
print(md1.solution[0])
print(md1.solution[1])
print(md1.loss_train)


# C - Test with different variants of this algorithm

md1 = PPSO(obj_func, lb4, ub4, verbose, epoch, pop_size)
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md1.train()
print(md1.solution[0])
print(md1.solution[1])
print(md1.loss_train)

md1 = PSO_W(obj_func, lb4, ub4, verbose, epoch, pop_size)
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md1.train()
print(md1.solution[0])
print(md1.solution[1])
print(md1.loss_train)

md1 = HPSO_TVA(obj_func, lb4, ub4, verbose, epoch, pop_size)
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md1.train()
print(md1.solution[0])
print(md1.solution[1])
print(md1.loss_train)
```

* The batch-size idea is not existed in Meta-heuristics field. I just take an inspiration from training batch-size 
  of neural network field and combine it with metaheuristics. Therefore, some algorithms will have it, some won't. 
  Don't worry, if you don't want to use it, just call the algorithm like usual, you don't need to specify any 
  additional parameters. But if you want to use it, check the example above, you need to specify some additional 
  hyper-parameters.
  
* **And PLEASE read some examples inside folder "examples" before email asking me how to call the optimizer. 
Lots of simple and complicated examples there. Take your time to learn how to use it.**
  

```python 
# Simple example: this is for previous version ( version <= 1.0.5)

from opfunu.cec_basic.cec2014_nobias import *
from mealpy.evolutionary_based.GA import BaseGA

## Setting parameters
obj_func = F1
# lb = [-15, -10, -3, -15, -10, -3, -15, -10, -3, -15, -10, -3, -15, -10, -3]
# ub = [15, 10, 3, 15, 10, 3, 15, 10, 3, 15, 10, 3, 15, 10, 3]
lb = [-100]
ub = [100]
problem_size = 100
batch_size = 25
verbose = True
epoch = 1000
pop_size = 50
pc = 0.95
pm = 0.025

md1 = BaseGA(obj_func, lb, ub, problem_size, batch_size, verbose, epoch, pop_size, 0.85, 0.05)
best_pos1, best_fit1, list_loss1 = md1.train()
print(md1.solution[0])
print(md1.solution[1])
print(md1.loss_train)

## Contributions

### Documents
* Meta-heuristic Categories: (Based on this article: [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2020.09.075))
    + Evolutionary: Evolutionary-based
    + Swarm: Swarm-based
    + Physics: Physics-based
    + Human: Human-based
    + Bio: Biology-based
    + System: System-based (eco-system, immune-system, network-system, ...)
    + Math: Math-based
    + Music: Music-based
    + Probabilistic: Probabilistic based algorithm
    + Dummy: Non-sense algorithms and Non-sense papers (code proofs)
        + All algorithms in this library were implemented by me (my code). Including the original version (I read the paper and implement it). Some original papers are very unclear (parameters, equations, algorithm's flow) as I
         categories it to dummy papers and algorithms (I have already checked carefully the paper, the related papers 
          and searched for Matlab code or any programming code for it). 

* Version: Most of the algorithms have the Original version and Base version.
    + original: Taken exactly from the paper
    + changed: Sometimes I changed the flow or how the new solution created/updated (equations) or remove some
      unnecessary parameters to make algorithm works

* Batch size idea (Personal Choice): Explained in the ChangeLog.md file and above. An algorithm can used it or not.
    
* Levy: Using levy-flight technique or not

* Type (Personal Opinion): (Based on performance of Base version. The Base version can be Original version)
    + weak: working fine with uni-modal and some multi-modal functions
    + strong: working good with uni-modal, multi-modal, some hybrid and some composite functions
    + best: working well with almost all kind of functions
    + BEST: the best among all algorithms

* Large-scale (Personal Opinion):
    + All algorithm here have been tested with large-scale dimension (2000)
    + Remember in CEC competition:
        + Normal test: 10, 50, 100
        + Large-scale: 100, 500, 1000

* Paras: The number of parameters in the algorithm (Not counting the fixed parameters in the original paper)
    + Almost algorithms have 2 paras (epoch, population_size) and plus some paras depend on each algorithm.
    + Some algorithms belong to "best" or "BEST" type and have only 2 paras meaning the algorithms are outstanding
    
* Difficulty - Difficulty Level (Personal Opinion): Objective observation from author. Depend on the number of 
  parameters, number of equations, the original ideas, time spend for coding, source lines of code (SLOC).
    + Easy: A few paras, few equations, SLOC very short
    + Medium: more equations than Easy level, SLOC longer than Easy level
    + Hard: Lots of equations, SLOC longer than Medium level, the paper hard to read.
    + Hard* - Very hard: Lots of equations, SLOC too long, the paper is very hard to read.
    
** For newbie, I recommend to read the paper of algorithms belong to "best or strong" type, "easy or medium" difficulty level.
