class Reader(object):
    """Opens a file and reads it in blocks, using the `Creator` class to
    instantiate an object for each of the blocks.

    The format is of the form:

    ```
    entry_type entry_id1
      command1 arg1 arg1b
      command2 arg2

    entry_type entry_id2
      command3 arg3 arg13
    ```

    When reading this file, the `Creator` will be instantiated with the
    provided args and kwargs to a `creator` object, whose methods will then
    be called in this pattern:

    ```
    creator.entry_type("entry_id1", 1)
    creator.command1("arg1 arg1b", 2)
    creator.command2("arg2", 3)
    creator.finish()

    creator.entry_type'entry_id2", 5)
    creator.command3("arg3 arg3b", 6)
    creator.finish()
