Description: This package creates Fractal networks.
        
        The steps for installation are as follows:
        
        1) pip install fractal-network-generator
        2) from fractal_network import NetworkGenerator
        3) NetworkGenerator.graph(num_of_levels,num_of_nodes_in_a_clique)
        
        OUTPUT:
        A file will be created in the current working directory having the name num_of_nodes_in_a_clique-num_of_levels.dat.
        Example: If NetworkGenerator.graph(4,3) is entered then a dat file with name "3-4.dat" will be created.
        
        Column 1: node number
        
        Column 2: label
        
        Column 3: Degree 
        
        The next columns indicate the neighbour and the level of connection between the node and neighbour alternately.
        For example:
        
        12 10110 3 10 2 13 1 14 1
        
        12 is the node numer, 10110 is the label, 3 is the degree.
        
        10 2 indicates a connection between 12 and 10 having level 2.
        
        13 1 indicates a connection between 12 and 13 having level 1.
        
        14 1 indicates a connection between 12 and 14 having level 1.
