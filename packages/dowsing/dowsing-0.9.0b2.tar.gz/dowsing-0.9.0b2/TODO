* dowsing.requires
  * equivalent to pep517.get_requirements_for_*
  * tracks where it was found (filename/node)
* dowsing.deps
  * dep walking code from honesty, plus build-from-source mode that has
    setup_requires
* general setuptools
  * allow find_packages (pypidb)
  * manifest (py.typed but doesn't include it)
* setup_py_parsing
  * recognize open-a-file-and-read-it
  * allow some string function calls (aioitertools)
  * "possible" and "required" imports (missing setup_requires, needs local stuff
    not in manifest, or requires->setup_requires)

* pyasn1 (`try/except to set params; params.update; setup(**params)`)
