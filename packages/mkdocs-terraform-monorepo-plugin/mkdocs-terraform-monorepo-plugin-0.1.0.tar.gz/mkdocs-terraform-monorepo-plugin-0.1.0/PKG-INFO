Description: 
                This introduces support for the !tf_modules_root syntax in mkdocs.yml, allowing you to import trees of README.md files for terraform modules directories that also contains a \*.tf file.
                It enables large or complex repositories to have their own tree of modules folders, whilst generating only a single Mkdocs site.
                This is built and maintained by the engineering community at Wunderman Thompson Commerce.
                It was, however, inspired by and adapted from the Spotify backstage monorepo plugin.
