snnTorch is a Python package for performing gradient-based learning with spiking neural networks.
Rather than reinventing the wheel, it sits on top of PyTorch and takes advantage of its GPU accelerated tensor 
computation. Pre-designed spiking neuron models are seamlessly integrated within the PyTorch framework and can be treated as recurrent activation units. 

snnTorch Structure

   * - Component
     - Description
   * - `snntorch <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.html>`_
     - a spiking neuron library like torch.nn, deeply integrated with autograd
   * - `snntorch.backprop <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.backprop.html>`_
     - variations of backpropagation commonly used with SNNs
   * - `snntorch.spikegen <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.spikegen.html>`_
     - a library for spike generation and data conversion
   * - `snntorch.spikeplot <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.spikeplot.html>`_
     - visualization tools for spike-based data using matplotlib and celluloid
   * - `snntorch.surrogate <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.surrogate.html>`_
     - optional surrogate gradient functions
   * - `snntorch.utils <https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/snntorch.utils.html>`_
     - dataset utility functions

snnTorch is designed to be intuitively used with PyTorch, as though each spiking neuron were simply another activation in a sequence of layers. 
It is therefore agnostic to fully-connected layers, convolutional layers, residual connections, etc. 

At present, the neuron models are represented by recursive functions which removes the need to store membrane potential traces for all neurons in a system in order to calculate the gradient. 
The lean requirements of snnTorch enable small and large networks to be viably trained on CPU, where needed. 
Provided that the network models and tensors are loaded onto CUDA, snnTorch takes advantage of GPU acceleration in the same way as PyTorch.
