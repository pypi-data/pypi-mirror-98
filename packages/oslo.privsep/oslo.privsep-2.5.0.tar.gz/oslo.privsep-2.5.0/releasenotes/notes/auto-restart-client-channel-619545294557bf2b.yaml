    When the privsep helper dies, the client side PrivContext now restarts the
    client channel and the helper so that privileged commands can continue to
    be processed. See `bug 1715374`_ for details. In conjunction with the fix
    for `bug 1794708`_ in oslo.service, the nova-compute service now behaves
    correctly when  it receives ``SIGHUP``.

    .. note:: This only works for the ``ROOTWRAP`` method of starting the
              daemon. With the ``FORK`` method we've dropped privileges and no
              longer have the ability to restart the daemon in privileged mode.
