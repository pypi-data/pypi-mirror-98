        * I wrote this script, because I wanted to configure a couple of linux servers to be able to use docker hub, which are blocked in Iran. And I wanted to get an agent to do it.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        ![How to use shecan?](./shecan.svg)
        
        ## Installation
        
        The following instructions will place the shecan executable in a
        virtualenv under `shecan/bin/shecan`.
        
        - Shecan **requires** `>= Python 3.6.1`
        
        ### pip
        
        This installs the latest stable, released version.
        
        ```
        $ python3.6 -m venv shecan
        $ shecan/bin/pip install shecan
        ```
        # Quickstart
        
        * Run ``shecan update`` - It will get Shecan DNS name servers and save them into a configuration file.
        * Run ``shecan list`` It will show shecan DNS name servers from the configuration file.
        * Run ``shecan set `` This will change your DNS temporarily by moving your current `/etc/resolv.conf` file and replace it with shecan DNS name server. **If you encounter permission problem** run the command this way: `sudo $(which shecan) set`.
        * Run ``shecan verify`` It will check your DNS configuration and make sure that shecan works fine for you.
        * Run ``shecan restore`` It will restore your previous DNS configuration.
        * Run ``shecan show`` It will print your current DNS configuration.
        * Run ``shecan --version`` It will show shecan's version.
        * Run ``shecan --help`` It will show full command-line options and subcommands.
