    """rewind a stack of changesets to a previous state

    This command can be used to restore stacks of changesets to an obsolete
    state, creating identical copies.

    There are two main ways to select the rewind target. Rewinding "from"
    changesets will restore the direct predecessors of these changesets (and
    obsolete the changeset you rewind from). Rewinding "to" will restore the
    changeset you have selected (and obsolete their latest successors).

    By default, we rewind from the working directory parents, restoring its
    predecessor.

    When we rewind to an obsolete version, we also rewind to all its obsolete
    ancestors. To only rewind to the explicitly selected changesets use the
    `--exact` flag. Using the `--exact` flag can restore some changesets as
    orphan.

    The latest successors of the obsolete changesets will be superseded by
    these new copies. This behavior can be disabled using `--as-divergence`,
    the current latest successors won't be affected and content-divergence will
    appear between them and the restored version of the obsolete changesets.

    Current rough edges:

      * fold: rewinding to only some of the initially folded changesets will be
              problematic. The fold result is marked obsolete and the part not
              rewinded to are "lost".  Please use --as-divergence when you
              need to perform such operation.

      * :hg:`rewind` might affect changesets outside the current stack. Without
              --exact, we also restore ancestors of the rewind target,
              obsoleting their latest successors (unless --as-divergent is
              provided). In some case, these latest successors will be on
              branches unrelated to the changeset you rewind from.
              (We plan to automatically detect this case in the future)
