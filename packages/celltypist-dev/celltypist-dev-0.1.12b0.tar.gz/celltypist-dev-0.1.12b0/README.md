# Overview of Celltypist
Celltypist is an automated cell type annotation tool for scRNA-seq datasets on the basis of logistic regression classifiers optimized by the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Celltypist provides several different models for predictions, with a current focus on immune sub-populations, in order to assist in the accurate classification of different cell types and subtypes.

# Install the development version
```console
pip install celltypist-dev
```

# Usage

## 1. Use in the Python environment

### 1.1. Import the module
```python
import celltypist
from celltypist import models
```

### 1.2. Download all available models
The models serve as the basis for cell type predictions. Each model is on average 5 megabytes (MB). We thus encourage the users to download all of them.
```python
#Download all the available models from the remote Sanger server.
models.download_models()
#Update all models by re-downloading the latest versions if you think they may be outdated.
models.update_models()
#Show the local directory storing these models.
models.models_path
```

### 1.3. Overview of the models
All models are serialized in a binary format by [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).
```python
#Get an overview of what these models represent and their names.
models.models_description()
```

### 1.4. Inspect the model of interest
To take a look at a given model, load the model as an instance of the `Model` class as defined in the Celltypist.
```python
#Select the model from the above list. If not provided, will default to `Immune_All_Low.pkl`.
model = models.load(model = 'Immune_All_Low.pkl')
#Examine cell types contained in the model.
model.cell_types
#Examine genes/features contained in the model.
model.features
#The stochastic gradient descent logistic regression classifier within the model.
model.classifier
```

### 1.5. Celltyping based on the input of count table 
Celltypist accepts the input data as a count table (cell-by-gene or gene-by-cell) in the format of `.txt`, `.csv`, `.tsv` or `.tab`. A raw count matrix (reads or UMIs) is required.
```python
#Get a demo test data. This is a UMI count csv file with cells as rows and genes as columns.
input_file = celltypist.samples.get_sample_csv()
```
Assign the cell type labels within the model to the input test cells using the `annotate` function.
```python
#Predict the cell identity of each input cell.
predictions = celltypist.annotate(input_file, model = 'Immune_All_Low.pkl')
```
If your input file is in a gene-by-cell format (genes as rows and cells as columns), add the `transpose_input = True` argument.
```python
#In case your input file is a gene-by-cell table.
predictions = celltypist.annotate(input_file, model = 'Immune_All_Low.pkl', transpose_input = True)
```
Similarly, if the `model` argument is not provided, Celltypist will by default use the `Immune_All_Low.pkl` model.
The `annotate` function will return an instance of the `AnnotationResult` class as defined in the Celltypist.
```python
#Examine the predicted cell types.
predictions.predicted_labels
#Examine the matrix representing the probability each cell belongs to a given cell type.
predictions.probability_table
#Export the above two results to an Excel table.
predictions.write_excel('/path/to/output.xlsx')
```
N.B. Non-expressed genes (if you are sure of their expression absence in your data) are suggested to be included in the input table, as they point to the negative transcriptomic signatures when compared with the model used.

### 1.6. Celltyping based on Scanpy h5ad data
Celltypist also accepts the input data as an `AnnData` generated from [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
Since the expression of each gene will be centered and scaled by matching with the provided model, Celltypist requires a logarithmized and normalized expression matrix stored in the `adata` (log1p normalized expression to 10000 counts per cell). Celltypist will try the `adata.X` first, and if it does not suffice, try the `adata.raw.X`. If none of them fit into the desired data type or the expression matrix is not properly normalized, an error will be raised.
```python
#Provide the input as a Scanpy object.
predictions = celltypist.annotate('/path/to/input/adata', model = 'Immune_All_Low.pkl')
#Examine the predicted cell types.
predictions.predicted_labels
#Examine the matrix representing the probability each cell belongs to a given cell type.
predictions.probability_table
#Export the above two results to an Excel table.
predictions.write_excel('/path/to/output.xlsx')
```

### 1.7. Use a majority voting classifier combined with celltyping 
By default, Celltypist will only do the prediction job to infer the identities of input cells, which renders the prediction of each cell independent. To combine the cell type predictions with the cell-cell transcriptomic relationships, Celltypist offers a majority voting approach based on the idea that similar cell subtypes are more likely to form a (sub)cluster regardless of their individual prediction outcomes.
To turn on the majority voting classifier in addition to the Celltypist predictions, add `majority_voting = True` to the `annotate` function. 
```python
#Turn on the majority voting classifier as well.
predictions = celltypist.annotate(input_file, model = 'Immune_All_Low.pkl', majority_voting = True)
```
During the majority voting, to define cell-cell relations, Celltypist will use a heuristic over-clustering approach according to the size of the input data with the aid of a canonical clustering pipeline. Users can also provide their own over-clustering result to the `over_clustering` argument. This argument can be specified in several ways:
   1) an input plain file with the over-clustering result of one cell per line.
   2) a string key specifying an existing metadata column in the `adata` (pre-created by the user).
   3) a Python list, Numpy 1D array, or Pandas series indicating the over-clustering result of all cells.
   4) if none of the above is provided, will use a heuristic over-clustering approach as mentioned.
```python
#Add your own over-clustering result.
predictions = celltypist.annotate(input_file, model = 'Immune_All_Low.pkl', majority_voting = True, over_clustering = '/path/to/over_clustering/file')
```
Again, an instance of the `AnnotationResult` class will be returned.
```python
#Inspect the result.
predictions.predicted_labels
predictions.probability_table
#Export the result.
predictions.write_excel('/path/to/output.xlsx')
```

## 2. Use as the command line

### 2.1. Check the command line options
```bash
celltypist --help
```

### 2.2. Download all available models
```bash
celltypist --update-models
```
This will download the latest models from the remote server.

### 2.3. Overview of the models
```bash
celltypist --show-models
```

### 2.4. Celltyping based on the input of count table
See `1.5.` for the format of the desired count matrix.
```bash
celltypist --indata /path/to/input/file --model Immune_All_Low.pkl --outdir /path/to/outdir
```
You can add a different model to be used in the `--model` option. If the `--model` is not provided, Celltypist will by default use the `Immune_All_Low.pkl` model. The output directory will be set to the current working directory if `--outdir` is not specified.
If your input file is in a gene-by-cell format (genes as rows and cells as columns), add the `--transpose-input` option.
```bash
celltypist --indata /path/to/input/file --model Immune_All_Low.pkl --outdir /path/to/outdir --transpose-input
```
Other options that control the output files of Celltypist include `--prefix` which adds a custom prefix and `--xlsx` which merges the output files into one xlsx table. Check `celltypist --help` for more details.

### 2.5. Celltyping based on Scanpy h5ad data
See `1.6.` for the requirement of the Scanpy expression data.
```bash
celltypist --indata /path/to/input/adata --model Immune_All_Low.pkl --outdir /path/to/outdir
```

### 2.6. Use a majority voting classifier combined with celltyping
See `1.7.` for how the majority voting classifier works.
```bash
celltypist --indata /path/to/input/file --model Immune_All_Low.pkl --outdir /path/to/outdir --majority-voting
```
During the majority voting, to define cell-cell relations, Celltypist will use a heuristic over-clustering approach according to the size of the input data with the aid of a canonical clustering pipeline. Users can also provide their own over-clustering result to the `--over-clustering` argument. This argument can be specified in several ways:
   1) an input plain file with the over-clustering result of one cell per line.
   2) a string key specifying an existing metadata column in the `adata` (pre-created by the user).
   3) if none of the above is provided, will use a heuristic over-clustering approach as mentioned.
```bash
celltypist --indata /path/to/input/file --model Immune_All_Low.pkl --outdir /path/to/outdir --majority-voting --over-clustering /path/to/over_clustering/file
```
