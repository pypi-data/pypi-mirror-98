## Setting up the Development Environment

### Getting the source code from GitHub

Clone the Buildnis Github repository using

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/Release-Candidate/Buildnis.git
```

or, if you are using SSH:

``` shell
git clone git@github.com:Release-Candidate/Buildnis.git
```

or enter the repository URI in the Git frontend of your choice (like [Tortoise Git](https://tortoisegit.org/) for Windows).

### Setting up the Python environment

First install the package `pipenv` to have a simple way to install all needed packages in a virtual Python environment for this project. So, first install the Pipenv using Pip:

``` shell
python -m pip install pipenv
```

Now, enter the root directory of the checked out Buildnis sources, `Buildnis`, and call

``` shell
pipenv install --dev
```

to install all the needed packages including these only needed for development (read from the file [Pipfile](./Pipfile)). After that you have all needed packages to develop, generate the documentation and run the program in this virtual environment, just always call `pipenv run` to run a python script or start a virtual environment in the current shell using `pipenv shell`. You can leave this virtual environment with the command `exit`.
