# Fastaudio
> An audio module for fastai v2. We want to help you build audio machine learning applications while minimizing the need for audio domain expertise. Currently under development.

# Quick Start

[Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastaudio/fastaudio/blob/master/docs//ESC50:%20Environmental%20Sound%20Classification.ipynb)

[Zachary Mueller's class](https://youtu.be/0IQYJNkAI3k?t=1665)

## Install


Install using pip:

```
pip install fastaudio
```

---

If you plan on **contributing** to the library instead, you will need to do a editable install:

```
# Optional step if using conda
conda create -n fastaudio python=3.7
conda activate fastaudio
```

```
# Editable install
git clone https://github.com/fastaudio/fastaudio.git
cd fastaudio
pip install -e .[dev,testing]
pre-commit install
```

# Testing
To run the tests and verify everything is working, run the following command from the `fastaudio/` folder (only applicable after doing the editable install steps):

```
pytest
```

This will run all of the test suit, reporting if there are any errors and also giving a code coverage report. Adittionally, there are extra checks that `pre-commit` run automatically every commit to verify the formatting and flake8 violations. If you want to run those manually, the command is `pre-commit run`

# Contributing to the library

We are looking for contributors of all skill levels. If you don't have time to contribute, please at least reach out and give us some feedback on the library.

Make sure that you have activated the environment that you used `pre-commit install` in so that pre-commit knows where to run the git hooks.

### How to contribute
Create issues, write documentation, suggest/add features, submit PRs. We are open to anything. A good first step would be posting in the [v2 audio thread](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastai-v2-audio/53535) introducing yourself.

## Note

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.3. For details and usage
