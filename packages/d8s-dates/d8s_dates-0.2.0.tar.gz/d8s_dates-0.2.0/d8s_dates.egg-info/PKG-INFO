        Democritus functions<sup>[1]</sup> for working with and using dates and times.
        
        [1] Democritus functions are <i>simple, effective, modular, well-tested, and well-documented</i> Python functions.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Coming soon...
        
        ## Development
        
        If you want to contribute to this project, make sure you have [docker][docker] and [docker-compose][docker-compose] installed (if you don't see: [installing docker][docker-install]).
        
        Once you have docker installed, you should [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repo.
        
        Then you can both *test* and *lint* this project using the docker-compose commands below!
        
        ### Testing
        
        To test this project, run the following command from the root directory of the repository:
        
        ```shell
        docker-compose run test
        ```
        
        To see what this command does, take a look at the `test` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
        
        ### Linting
        
        To lint<sup>1</sup> this project, run the following command from the root directory of the repository:
        
        ```shell
        docker-compose run lint
        ```
        
        To see what this command does, take a look at the `lint` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
        
        ### Dev
        
        To drop into a "dev" environment which is an [IPython][ipython] shell with all of the requirements and this project loaded, run the following command from the root directory of the repository:
        
        ```shell
        docker-compose run dev
        ```
        
        To see what this command does, take a look at the `dev` service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
