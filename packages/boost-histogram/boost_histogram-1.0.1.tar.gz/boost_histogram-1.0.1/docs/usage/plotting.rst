Plotting
========

Boost-histogram does not contain plotting functions - this is outside of the
scope of the project, which is histogram filling and manipulation. However, it
does follow ``PlottableProtocol``. Any plotting library that
accepts an object that follows the ``PlottableProtocol`` can plot boost-histogram
objects.

Read about the ``PlottableProtocol`` in the `UHI plotting <https://uhi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plotting.html>`_ page.
