Description: 
                ## scdata - Analysis of sensors and time series data
        
                `scdata` is a **sensor data analysis framework** built with the purpose of *analysis*, 
                *calibration* and *post-processing* of sensor data. It is particularly 
                focused on sensors for environmental monitoring such as the low-cost sensors in the 
                [Smart Citizen Project](https://www.smartcitizen.me). As such provides
                tools for workflow automation and sensor calibration.
        
                It aims to unify several sources of data and to provide tools for analysing data by:
        
                * Interacting with several sensors APIs
                * Clean data, export and calculate metrics
                * Model sensor data and calibrate sensors
                * Generate data visualisations
