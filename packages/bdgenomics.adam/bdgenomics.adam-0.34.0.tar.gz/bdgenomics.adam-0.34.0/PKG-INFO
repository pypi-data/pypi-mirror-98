Description: # ADAM
        
        ADAM is a library and command line tool that enables the use of [Apache
        Spark](https://spark.apache.org) to parallelize genomic data analysis across
        cluster/cloud computing environments. ADAM uses a set of schemas to describe
        genomic sequences, reads, variants/genotypes, and features, and can be used
        with data in legacy genomic file formats such as SAM/BAM/CRAM, BED/GFF3/GTF,
        and VCF, as well as data stored in the columnar
        [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) format. On a single node, ADAM
        provides competitive performance to optimized multi-threaded tools, while
        enabling scale out to clusters with more than a thousand cores. ADAM's APIs
        can be used from Scala, Java, Python, R, and SQL.
        
        ## Documentation
        
        ADAM's documentation is hosted at [readthedocs](http://adam.readthedocs.io).
        
        ## Python Requirements
        
        ADAM depends on having PySpark installed.
