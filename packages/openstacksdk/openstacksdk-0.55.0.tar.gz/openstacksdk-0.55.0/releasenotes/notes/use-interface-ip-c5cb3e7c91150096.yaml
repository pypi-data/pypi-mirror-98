fixes:
  - shade now correctly does not try to attach a floating ip with auto_ip
    if the cloud has given a public IPv6 address and the calling context
    supports IPv6 routing. shade has always used this logic to determine
    the server 'interface_ip', but the auto floating ip was incorrectly only
    looking at the 'public_v4' value to determine whether the server needed
    additional networking.
upgrade:
  - If your cloud presents a default split IPv4/IPv6 stack with a public
    v6 and a private v4 address and you have the expectation that auto_ip
    should procure a v4 floating ip, you need to set 'force_ipv4' to True in
    your clouds.yaml entry for the cloud.
