    openstacksdk does not test or support python2 as of 0.40,
    but the releases have still accidentally worked (except for
    0.44 which was broken for python2). We're now explicitly
    marking releases as requiring >= 3.5 so that things don't
    attempt to install something that's bound to be broken.
