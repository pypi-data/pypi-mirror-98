    ``has_{service_type}`` is a boolean config option that allows
    asserting that a given service does not exist or should not be used
    in a given cloud. Doing this will now cause the corresponding
    service ``Proxy`` object to not be created and in its place is
    an object that will throw exceptions if used.
  - |
    ``{service_type}_disabled_reason`` is a new string config option
    that can be set to indicate a reason why a service has been disabled.
    This string will be used in exceptions or log warnings emitted.
