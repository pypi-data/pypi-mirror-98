features:
  - If a cloud does not have a neutron service, it is now
    assumed that Nova will be the source of security groups.
    To handle clouds that have nova-network and do not have
    the security group extension, setting secgroup_source to
    None will prevent attempting to use them at all. If the
    cloud has neutron but it is not a functional source of
    security groups, set secgroup_source to nova.
