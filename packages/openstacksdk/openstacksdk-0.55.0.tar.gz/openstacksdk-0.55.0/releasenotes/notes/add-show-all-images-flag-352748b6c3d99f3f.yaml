features:
  - Added flag "show_all" to list_images. The behavior of
    Glance v2 to only show shared images if they have been
    accepted by the user can be confusing, and the only way
    to change it is to use search_images(filters=dict(member_status='all'))
    which isn't terribly obvious. "show_all=True" will set
    that flag, as well as disabling the filtering of images
    in "deleted" state.
