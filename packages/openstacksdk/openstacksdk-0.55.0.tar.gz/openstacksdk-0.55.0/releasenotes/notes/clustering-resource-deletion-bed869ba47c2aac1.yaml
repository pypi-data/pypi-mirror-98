    Fixed a regression in deleting Node and Cluster resources
    in clustering caused by the addition of the ``location``
    property to all resource objects. Previously the delete
    calls had directly returned the ``location`` field
    returned in the headers from the clustering service pointing
    to an Action resource that could be fetched to get status
    on the delete operation. The delete calls now return an
    Action resource directly that is correctly constructed
    so that ``wait_for_status`` and ``wait_for_deleted``
    work as expected.
