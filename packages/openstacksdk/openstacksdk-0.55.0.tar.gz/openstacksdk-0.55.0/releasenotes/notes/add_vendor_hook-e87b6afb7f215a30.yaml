    Add possibility to automatically invoke vendor hooks. This can be done
    either through extending profile (vendor_hook), or passing `vendor_hook`
    parameter to the connection. The format of the vendor_hook is the same as
    in the setuptools (module.name:function_name). The hook will get connection
    as the only parameter.
