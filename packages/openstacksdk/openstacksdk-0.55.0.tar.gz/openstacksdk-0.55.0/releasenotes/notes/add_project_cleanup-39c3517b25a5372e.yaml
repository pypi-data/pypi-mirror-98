    Project cleanup functionality. It provides a single method in the
    connection object, which calls cleanup method in all supported services
    (both part of the SDK itself and all "imported" in the runtime or through
    the vendor_hook functionality). Cleanup is working in multiple threads
    where possible (no dependencies between services).
