    Vendor profiles can now be fetched from an RFC 5785 compliant URL on a
    cloud, namely, ``https://example.com/.well-known/openstack/api``. A cloud
    can manage their own vendor profile and serve it from that URL, allowing
    a user to simply list ``https://example.com`` as the profile name.
