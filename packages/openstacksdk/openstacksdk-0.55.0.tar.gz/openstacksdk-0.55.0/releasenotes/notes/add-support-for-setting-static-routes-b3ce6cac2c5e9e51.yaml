    The networking API v2 specification, which is implemented by OpenStack
    Neutron, features an optional routes parameter - when updating a router
    (PUT requests). Static routes are crucial for routers to handle traffic
    from subnets not directly connected to a router.  The routes parameter has
    now been added to the OpenStackCloud.update_router method as a list of
    dictionaries with destination and nexthop parameters.
