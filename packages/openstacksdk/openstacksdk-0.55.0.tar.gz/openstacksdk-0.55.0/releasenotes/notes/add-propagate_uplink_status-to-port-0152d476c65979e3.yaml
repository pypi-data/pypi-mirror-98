    Add ``propagate_uplink_status`` attribute to ``port`` resource.
    Users can set this attribute to ``True`` or ``False``.
    If it is set to ``True``, uplink status propagation is enabled.
    Otherwise, it is disabled.
    Neutron server needs to have the API extension
    ``uplink-status-propagation`` in order to support this feature.
    This feature can be used in SRIOV scenario, in which users
    enable uplink status propagation of the SRIOV port
    so that the link status of the VF will follow the PF.
