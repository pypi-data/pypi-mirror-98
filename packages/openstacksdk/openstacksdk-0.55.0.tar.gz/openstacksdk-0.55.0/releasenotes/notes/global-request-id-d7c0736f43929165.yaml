    Added support for setting ``global_request_id`` on a ``Connection``.
    If done, this will cause all requests sent to send the request id
    header to the OpenStack services. Since ``Connection`` can otherwise
    be used multi-threaded, add a method ``global_request`` that returns
    a new ``Connection`` based on the old ``Connection`` but on which
    the new ``global_request_id`` has been set. Since a ``Connection``
    can be used as a context manager, this also means the ``global_request``
    method can be used in ``with`` statements.
