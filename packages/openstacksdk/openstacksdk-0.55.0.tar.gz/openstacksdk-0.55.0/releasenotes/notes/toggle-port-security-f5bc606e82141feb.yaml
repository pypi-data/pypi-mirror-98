    Added a new property, 'port_security_enabled' which is a boolean
    to enable or disable port_secuirty during network creation. The
    default behavior will enable port security, security group and
    anti spoofing will act as before. When the attribute is set to
    False, security group and anti spoofing are disabled on the ports
    created on this network.
