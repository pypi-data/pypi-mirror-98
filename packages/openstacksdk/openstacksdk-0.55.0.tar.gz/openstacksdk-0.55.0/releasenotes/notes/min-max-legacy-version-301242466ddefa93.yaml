features:
  - Add min_version and max_version to get_legacy_client
    and to get_session_endpoint. At the moment this is only
    really fully plumbed through for cinder, which has extra
    special fun around volume, volumev2 and volumev3. Min and max
    versions to both methods will look through the options available
    in the service catalog and try to return the latest one available
    from the span of requested versions. This means a user can say
    volume_api_version=None, min_version=2, max_version=3 will get
    an endpoint from get_session_endpoint or a Client from cinderclient
    that will be either v2 or v3 but not v1. In the future, min and max
    version for get_session_endpoint should be able to sort out
    appropriate endpoints via version discovery, but that does not
    currently exist.
