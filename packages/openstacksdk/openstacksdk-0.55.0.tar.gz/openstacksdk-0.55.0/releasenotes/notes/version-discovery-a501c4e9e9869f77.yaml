features:
  - Version discovery is now done via the keystoneauth
    library. shade still has one behavioral difference
    from default keystoneauth behavior, which is that
    shade will use a version it understands if it can
    find one even if the user has requested a different
    version. This change opens the door for shade to
    start being able to consume API microversions as
    needed.
upgrade:
  - keystoneauth version 3.2.0 or higher is required
    because of version discovery.
