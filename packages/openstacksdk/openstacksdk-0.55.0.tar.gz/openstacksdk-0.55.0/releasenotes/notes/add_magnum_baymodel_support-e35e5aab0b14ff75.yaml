features:
  - Add support for Magnum baymodels, with the
    usual methods (search/list/get/create/update/delete). Due to upcoming
    rename in Magnum from baymodel to cluster_template, the shade
    functionality uses the term cluster_template. However, baymodel aliases
    are provided for each api call.
