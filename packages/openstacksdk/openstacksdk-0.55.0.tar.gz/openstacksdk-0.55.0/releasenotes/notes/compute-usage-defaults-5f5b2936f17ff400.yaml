features:
  - get_compute_usage now has a default value for the start
    parameter of 2010-07-06. That was the date the OpenStack
    project started. It's completely impossible for someone
    to have Nova usage data that goes back further in time.
    Also, both the start and end date parameters now also
    accept strings which will be parsed and timezones will
    be properly converted to UTC which is what Nova expects.
