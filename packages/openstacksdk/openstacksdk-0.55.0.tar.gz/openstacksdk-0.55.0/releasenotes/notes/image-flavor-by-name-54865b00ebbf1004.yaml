features:
  - The image and flavor parameters for create_server
    now accept name in addition to id and dict. If given
    as a name or id, shade will do a get_image or a
    get_flavor to find the matching image or flavor.
    If you have an id already and are not using any caching
    and the extra lookup is annoying, passing the id in
    as "dict(id='my-id')" will avoid the lookup.
