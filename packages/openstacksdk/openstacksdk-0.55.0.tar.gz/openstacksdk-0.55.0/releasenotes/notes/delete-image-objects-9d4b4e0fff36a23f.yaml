fixes:
  - Delete swift objects uploaded in service of uploading images
    at the time that the corresponding image is deleted. On some clouds,
    image uploads are accomplished by uploading the image to swift and
    then running a task-import. As shade does this action on behalf of the
    user, it is not reasonable to assume that the user would then be aware
    of or manage the swift objects shade created, which led to an ongoing
    leak of swift objects.
  - Upload swift Large Objects as Static Large Objects by default. Shade
    automatically uploads objects as Large Objects when they are over a
    segment_size threshold. It had been doing this as Dynamic Large Objects,
    which sound great, but which have the downside of not deleting their
    sub-segments when the primary object is deleted. Since nothing in the
    shade interface exposes that the object was segmented, the user would not
    know they would also need to find and delete the segments. Instead, we
    now upload as Static Large Objects which behave as expected and delete
    segments when the object is deleted.
