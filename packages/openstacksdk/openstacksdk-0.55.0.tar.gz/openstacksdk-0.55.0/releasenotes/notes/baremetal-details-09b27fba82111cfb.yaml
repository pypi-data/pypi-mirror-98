features:
  - |
    The objects returned by baremetal detailed listing functions
    (``connection.baremetal.{nodes,ports,chassis,port_groups}``) are now
    fully functional, e.g. can be directly updated or deleted.
deprecations:
  - |
    The following baremetal resource classes are no longer used and will be
    removed in a future release: ``NodeDetail``, ``PortDetail``,
    ``ChassisDetail`` and ``PortGroupDetail``. The regular ``Node``, ``Port``,
    ``Chassis`` and ``PortGroup`` are now used instead.
