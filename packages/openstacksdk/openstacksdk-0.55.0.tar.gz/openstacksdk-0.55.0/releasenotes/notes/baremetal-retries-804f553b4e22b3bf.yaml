    Changes the ``baremetal.attach_vif_to_node`` call to retry HTTP CONFLICT
    by default. While it's a valid error code when a VIF is already attached
    to a node, the same code is also used when the target node is locked.
    The latter happens more often, so the retries are now on by default and
    can be disabled by setting ``retry_on_conflict`` to ``False``.
