    In April 2019 the microversion support for the Server resource was increased
    to ``2.72``. Unfortunately, due to an issue with version discovery documents,
    this increase never actually became effective. A fix is coming in ``3.17.2`` of
    ``keystoneauth`` which will unbreak version discovery and cause the microversion
    support to start working.

  - |
    Due to the fix in microversion support in `keystoneauth`, Servers will be
    fetched using microversion ``2.72``. Code that assumes the existence of a
    ``flavor.id`` field in the Server record should be removed, as it does not exist
    in new microversions and cannot be filled in behind the scenes.
