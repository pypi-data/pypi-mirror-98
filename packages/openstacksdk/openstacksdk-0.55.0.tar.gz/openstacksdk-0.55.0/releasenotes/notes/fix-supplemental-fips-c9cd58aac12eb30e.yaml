fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where shade could report a floating IP being attached
    to a server erroneously due to only matching on fixed ip. Changed the
    lookup to match on port ids. This adds an API call in the case where
    the workaround is needed because of a bug in the cloud, but in most
    cases it should have no difference.
