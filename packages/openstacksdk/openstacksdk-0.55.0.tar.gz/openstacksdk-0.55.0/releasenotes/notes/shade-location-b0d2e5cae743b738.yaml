    The base ``Resource`` field ``location`` is no longer drawn from the
    ``Location`` HTTP header, but is instead a dict containing information
    about cloud, domain and project. The location dict is a feature of shade
    objects and is being added to all objects as part of the alignment of
    shade and sdk.
