    Fixes API version negotiation in the following bare metal node calls:

    * ``set_node_provision_state``
    * ``set_node_power_state``
    * ``patch_node``

    Previously an unexpectingly low version could be negotiated, breaking
    certain features, for example calling the ``provide`` provisioning action
    with a node name.
