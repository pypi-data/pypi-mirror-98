    The ``v3password`` ``auth_type`` implies that the ``auth_url`` given
    is a versioned endpoint and so discovery is skipped for auth. Previously
    the ``auth_type`` for Vexxhost had been set to ``v3password`` due to v2
    being no longer available to give better errors to users. The ``auth_url``
    was unfortunately left unversioned, so authentication ceased working. The
    ``auth_url`` has been changed to the versioned endpoint.
