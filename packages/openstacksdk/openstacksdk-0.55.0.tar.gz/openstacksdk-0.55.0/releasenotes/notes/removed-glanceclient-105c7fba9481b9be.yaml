    The ``shade`` and ``os-client-config`` libraries have been merged
    in to openstacksdk. As a result, their functionality is being
    integrated into the sdk functionality, and in some cases is replacing
    exisiting things.

    The ``openstack.profile.Profile`` and
    ``openstack.auth.base.BaseAuthPlugin`` classes are no more. Profile has
    been replace by ``openstack.config.cloud_region.CloudRegion`` from
    `os-client-config
    <https://opendev.org/openstack/os-client-config>`_
    ``openstack.auth.base.BaseAuthPlugin`` has been replaced with the Auth
    plugins from keystoneauth.

    Service proxy names on the ``openstack.connection.Connection`` are all
    based on the official names from the OpenStack Service Types Authority.

    ``openstack.proxy.Proxy`` is now a subclass of
    ``keystoneauth1.adapter.Adapter``. Removed local logic that duplicates
    keystoneauth logic. This means every proxy also has direct REST primitives
    available.

        connection = connection.Connection()
        servers = connection.compute.servers()
        server_response = connection.compute.get('/servers')
