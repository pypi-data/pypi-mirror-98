    Added new option for Connection, ``strict_proxies``. When set to ``True``,
    Connection will throw a ``ServiceDiscoveryException`` if the endpoint for
    a given service doesn't work. This is useful for OpenStack services using
    sdk to talk to other OpenStack services where it can be expected that the
    deployer config is correct and errors should be reported immediately.
