fixes:
  - Added requests and Babel to the direct dependencies list to work around
    issues with pip installation, entrypoints and transitive dependencies
    with conflicting exclusion ranges. Packagers of shade do not need to
    add these two new requirements to shade's dependency list - they are
    transitive depends and should be satisfied by the other things in the
    requirements list. Both will be removed from the list again once the
    python client libraries that pull them in have been removed.
