Getting started with the OpenStack SDK
======================================

For a listing of terms used throughout the SDK, including the names of
projects and services supported by it, see the :doc:`glossary <../glossary>`.

Installation
------------

The OpenStack SDK is available on
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/openstacksdk>`_ under the name
**openstacksdk**. To install it, use ``pip``::

   $ pip install openstacksdk

To check the installed version you can call the module with ::

   $ python -m openstack version

User Guides
-----------

These guides walk you through how to make use of the libraries we provide
to work with each OpenStack service. If you're looking for a cookbook
approach, this is where you'll want to begin.

API Documentation
-----------------

Service APIs are exposed through a two-layered approach. The classes
exposed through our *Connection* interface are the place to start if you're
an application developer consuming an OpenStack cloud. The *Resource*
interface is the layer upon which the *Connection* is built, with
*Connection* methods accepting and returning *Resource* objects.

The Cloud Abstraction layer has a data model.

Connection Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *Connection* instance maintains your cloud config, session and authentication
information providing you with a set of higher-level interfaces to work with
OpenStack services.

.. toctree::

   connection

Once you have a *Connection* instance, services are accessed through instances
of :class:`~openstack.proxy.Proxy` or subclasses of it that exist as
attributes on the :class:`~openstack.connection.Connection`.

.. _service-proxies:

Service Proxies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following service proxies exist on the
:class:`~openstack.connection.Connection`. The service proxies are all always
present on the :class:`~openstack.connection.Connection` object, but the
combination of your ``CloudRegion`` and the catalog of the cloud in question
control which services can be used.

Resource Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *Resource* layer is a lower-level interface to communicate with OpenStack
services. While the classes exposed by the *Connection* build a convenience
layer on top of this, *Resources* can be used directly. However, the most
common usage of this layer is in receiving an object from a class in the
*Connection* layer, modifying it, and sending it back into the *Connection*
layer, such as to update a resource on the server.

The following services have exposed *Resource* classes.

Low-Level Classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following classes are not commonly used by application developers,
but are used to construct applications to talk to OpenStack APIs. Typically
these parts are managed through the `Connection Interface`_, but their use
can be customized.
