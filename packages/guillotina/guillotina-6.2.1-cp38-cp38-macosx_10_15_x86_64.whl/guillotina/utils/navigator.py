    Provides a consistent view of the loaded objects, ensuring that only
    a single instance of each resource path is loaded.

    It is particularly useful when objects that may have been modified or
    added have to be found by path (something that the :mod:`content` api
    cannot do).

    To keep the Navigator index consistent, all object loadings must be done
    through its API, meaning the content api should not be used anymore.
    In case it cannot be avoided, make sure to use the :func:`sync` function
    before re-using the Navigator.
