< 4.3 to 4.3
============

Moving async utilities to be loaded explicit:

- Check which async utilities you want to use on your addon by default

- Move them to `__init__.py` settings like::

	...
	app_settings = {
	    "load_utilities": {
	        "catalog": {
	            "provides": "guillotina_elasticsearch.utility.IElasticSearchUtility",  # noqa
	            "factory": "guillotina_elasticsearch.utility.ElasticSearchUtility",
	            "settings": {}
	        }
	    },
	...

- Remove any reference to app_settings['utilities'] (that was a list) to app_settings['load_utilities']
