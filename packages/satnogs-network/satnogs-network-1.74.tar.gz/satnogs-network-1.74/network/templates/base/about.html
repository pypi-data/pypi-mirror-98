      <h1>About</h1>
      SatNOGS Network is a global management interface to facilitate multiple ground station
      operations remotely. An observer is able to take advantage of the full network of
      SatNOGS ground stations around the world.
      It's part of the <a href="https://satnogs.org/" target="_blank">SatNOGS project</a>.
      <h3>Observations</h3>
      The network is open to anyone. Any observer is able to utilize all available Ground Stations
      and communicate with Satellites. All observations results are public
      and all data are distributed freely under the
