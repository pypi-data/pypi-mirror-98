# compress-pptx

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/compress-pptx.svg)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/compress-pptx)

Compress a PPTX file, converting all PNG/TIFF images to lossy JPEGs.

## What it does

When copy-pasting images to PowerPoint presentations, these sometimes get inserted as lossless versions, blowing up the size of the presentation.

This script takes all PNG or TIFF images part of the presentation which are larger than a given threshold (1 MiB by default), converts them to a lossy JPEG variant, and creates a new PPTX file.

:warning: This is not the same as compressing images with PowerPoint's own functionality. You may still need to do this to reduce the size of your presentation!

PNGs containing transparency will be skipped to prevent graphics issues.
## Requirements

- Python 3.5 or higher
- ImageMagick's `magick`, which calls `convert` and `identify`

Under Ubuntu, get ImageMagick via:

```
apt install imagemagick
```

## Installation

Via pip:

```
pip3 install --user compress-pptx
```

## Usage

Call `compress_pptx` and point it to a PPTX file. It'll compress the images and output another compressed file next to it.

For more options, see the `-h` output:

```
compress_pptx [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-s SIZE] [-q QUALITY] [-v] input

positional arguments:
  input

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output file
  -s SIZE, --size SIZE  Minimum size threshold in bytes. Also accepts the suffixes k/M/G or KiB/MiB/GiB
  -q QUALITY, --quality QUALITY
                        JPEG output quality (0-100)
  -v, --verbose         Show additional info
```
