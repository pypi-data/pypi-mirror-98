Description: # compress-pptx
        
        [![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/compress-pptx.svg)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/compress-pptx)
        
        Compress a PPTX file, converting all PNG/TIFF images to lossy JPEGs.
        
        ## What it does
        
        When copy-pasting images to PowerPoint presentations, these sometimes get inserted as lossless versions, blowing up the size of the presentation.
        
        This script takes all PNG or TIFF images part of the presentation which are larger than a given threshold (1 MiB by default), converts them to a lossy JPEG variant, and creates a new PPTX file.
        
        :warning: This is not the same as compressing images with PowerPoint's own functionality. You may still need to do this to reduce the size of your presentation!
        
        PNGs containing transparency will be skipped to prevent graphics issues.
        ## Requirements
        
        - Python 3.5 or higher
        - ImageMagick's `magick`, which calls `convert` and `identify`
        
        Under Ubuntu, get ImageMagick via:
        
        ```
        apt install imagemagick
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        Via pip:
        
        ```
        pip3 install --user compress-pptx
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Call `compress-pptx` and point it to a PPTX file. It'll compress the images and output another compressed file next to it.
        
        For more options, see the `-h` output:
        
        ```
        compress-pptx [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-s SIZE] [-q QUALITY] [-v] input
        
        positional arguments:
          input
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                                Output file
          -s SIZE, --size SIZE  Minimum size threshold in bytes. Also accepts the suffixes k/M/G or KiB/MiB/GiB
          -q QUALITY, --quality QUALITY
                                JPEG output quality (0-100)
          -v, --verbose         Show additional info
        ```
        
        ## Bash Version
        
        There's an unmaintained Bash version under `bash/compress-pptx.sh`.
