    Hosts different filter sets to for ecoinvent activities and exchanges.

    It stores:
    * material_filters: filters for activities related to materials.
    * powerplant_filters: filters for activities related to power generation technologies.
    * emissions_map: REMIND emission labels as keys, ecoinvent emission labels as values

    The functions :func:`generate_material_map` and :func:`generate_powerplant_map` can
    be used to extract the actual activity objects as dictionaries.
    These functions return the result of applying :func:`act_fltr` to the filter dictionaries.
