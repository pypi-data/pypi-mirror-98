Description: 
        The ``pyPM.ca`` population modeller (www.pyPM.ca) describes connected systems with
        discrete-time difference equations. It was developed specifically
        to understand and characterize the CoViD-19 epidemic.
        
        A ``pyPM.ca`` model is built by connecting a set of population objects with
        connector objects. The connectors represent either a transfer that occurs
        immediately at the next time step
        or one which is delayed and distributed in time. Each
        population object retains a record of its size at each time step, and also
        maintains a list of future contributions, arising from delayed transfers
        from other populations.
        Calculations of population size are done either in terms of expectation values 
        or simulated data,
        allowing the model to be used for both analysis and simulation.
