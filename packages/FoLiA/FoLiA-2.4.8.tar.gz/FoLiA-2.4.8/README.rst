This Python module provides an extensive library for parsing, creating and otherwise processing documents in the `Format
for Linguistic Annotation <https://proycon.github.io/folia>`_, aka `FoLiA <https://proycon.github.io/folia>`_. It has
been in active development since 2010 and used by numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools.

This library used to be part of `PyNLPL <https://github.com/proycon/pynlpl>`_ (``pynlpl.formats.folia``), but has been
migrated to this standalone library in spring 2019.

Acknowledgement

FoLiA development is funded in the scope of the larger CLARIN-NL project and its successor CLARIAH.


The following modules are available:

* ``folia.main`` - The main library
* ``folia.setdefinition`` - A module for FoLiA Set Definitions
* ``folia.fql`` - Support for the FoLiA Query Language (FQL)
