        # About Scalene
        
        ```
          % pip install -U scalene
        ```
        
        Scalene is a high-performance CPU, GPU *and* memory profiler for Python that does a number of things that other Python profilers do not and cannot do.  It runs orders of magnitude faster than other profilers while delivering far more detailed information.
        
        ### Fast and Precise
        
        - Scalene is **_fast_**. It uses sampling instead of instrumentation or relying on Python's tracing facilities. Its overhead is typically no more than 10-20% (and often less).
        - Scalene performs profiling **_at the line level_**, pointing to the specific lines of code that are responsible for the execution time in your program. This level of detail can be much more useful than the function-level profiles returned by most profilers.
        
        ### CPU profiling
        
        - Scalene **separates out time spent in Python from time in native code** (including libraries). Most Python programmers aren't going to optimize the performance of native code (which is usually either in the Python implementation or external libraries), so this helps developers focus their optimization efforts on the code they can actually improve.
        - Scalene **highlights hotspots** (code accounting for significant percentages of CPU time or memory allocation) in red, making them even easier to spot.
        - Scalene also separates out **system time**, making it easy to find I/O bottlenecks.
        
        ### GPU profiling
        
        - Scalene reports **GPU time** (currently limited to nVidia-based systems).
        
        ### Memory profiling
        
        - Scalene **profiles memory usage**. In addition to tracking CPU usage, Scalene also points to the specific lines of code responsible for memory growth. It accomplishes this via an included specialized memory allocator.
        - Scalene separates out the percentage of **memory consumed by Python code vs. native code**.
        - Scalene produces **_per-line_ memory profiles**.
        - Scalene **identifies likely memory leaks**.
        - Scalene **profiles _copying volume_**, making it easy to spot inadvertent copying, especially due to crossing Python/library boundaries (e.g., accidentally converting `numpy` arrays into Python arrays, and vice versa).
        
        ### Other features
        
        - Scalene can produce **reduced profiles** (via `--reduced-profile`) that only report lines that consume more than 1% of CPU or perform at least 100 allocations.
        - Scalene supports `@profile` decorators to profile only specific functions.
        
        # Comparison to Other Profilers
        
        ## Performance and Features
        
        Below is a table comparing the **performance and features** of various profilers to Scalene.
        
        ![Performance and feature comparison](https://github.com/plasma-umass/scalene/blob/master/images/profiler-comparison.png)
        
        **Function-granularity profilers** report information only for an entire function, while **line-granularity profilers** (like Scalene) report information for every line
        
        - **Time** is either real (wall-clock time), CPU-only, or both.
        - **Efficiency**: :green_circle: = fast, :yellow_circle: = slower, :red_circle: = slowest
        - **Mem Cons.**: tracks memory consumption
        - **Unmodified Code**: works on unmodified code
        - **Threads**: works correctly with threads
        - **Python/C**: separately attributes Python/C time and memory consumption
        - **Mem Trend**: shows memory usage trends over time
        - **Copy Vol.**: reports _copy volume_, the amount of megabytes being copied per second
        
        ## Output
        
        Scalene prints annotated source code for the program being profiled
        (either as text or as HTML via the `--html` option) and any modules it
        uses in the same directory or subdirectories (you can optionally have
        it `--profile-all` and only include files with at least a
        `--cpu-percent-threshold` of time).  Here is a snippet from
        `pystone.py`.
        
        ![Example profile](https://github.com/plasma-umass/scalene/blob/master/images/sample-profile-pystone.png)
        
        * **Memory usage at the top**: Visualized by "sparklines", memory consumption over the runtime of the profiled code. Scalene is a statistical profiler, meaning that it does sampling, and variance can certainly happen. A longer-running program that allocates and frees more memory will have more stable results.
        * **"CPU % Python"**: How much time was spent in Python code.
        * **"CPU % Native"**: How much time was spent in non-Python code (e.g., libraries written in C/C++).
        * **"Mem % Python"**: How much of the memory allocation happened on the Python side of the code, as opposed to in non-Python code (e.g., libraries written in C/C++).
        * **"Net (MB)"**: Positive net memory numbers indicate total memory allocation in megabytes; negative net memory numbers indicate memory reclamation.
        * **"Memory usage over time / %"**: Visualized by "sparklines", memory consumption generated by this line over the program runtime, and the percentages of total memory activity this line represents.
        * **"Copy (MB/s)"**: The amount of megabytes being copied per second (see "About Scalene").

        ## Installation
        
        ### pip (Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows WSL2)
        
        Scalene is distributed as a `pip` package and works on Mac OS X and Linux platforms (including Ubuntu in [Windows WSL2](docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index)).
        
        You can install it as follows:
        ```
          % pip install -U scalene
        ```
        
        or
        ```
          % python3 -m pip install -U scalene
        ```
        
        ### Homebrew (Mac OS X)
        
        As an alternative to `pip`, you can use Homebrew to install the current version of Scalene from this repository:
        
        ```
          % brew tap plasma-umass/scalene
          % brew install --head libscalene
        ```
        
        ### ArchLinux
        
        **NEW**: You can also install Scalene on Arch Linux via the [AUR
        package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-scalene-git/). Use your favorite AUR helper, or
        manually download the `PKGBUILD` and run `makepkg -cirs` to build. Note that this will place
        `libscalene.so` in `/usr/lib`; modify the below usage instructions accordingly.
