    Produces a tween which will convert ``sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError``
    instances (caused by database server restart) into a retryable error
    instance, so that a second attempt may be made to connect to the database
    before really giving up.

    .. note::
       This tween alone is not enough to cause the transaction to be retried;
       it only marks the error as being *retryable*.  If you wish more than one
       attempt to be made, you must define the ``retry.attempts`` (or
       ``tm.attempts`` if running pyramid<1.9) setting within your Pyramid app
       configuration.  For more info see `Retrying`_.
