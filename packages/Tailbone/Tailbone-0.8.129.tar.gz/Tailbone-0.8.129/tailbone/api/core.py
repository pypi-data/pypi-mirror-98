        """
        This method is present on *all* API views, and is meant to provide a
        single means of obtaining "common" user info, for return to the caller.
        Such info may be returned in several places, e.g. upon login but also
        in the "check session" call, or e.g. as part of a broader return value
        from any other call.

        :returns: Dictionary of user info data, ready for JSON serialization. 

        Note that you should *not* (usually) override this method in any view,
        but instead configure a "supplemental" function which can then add or
        replace info entries.  Config for that looks like e.g.:

        .. code-block:: ini

           [tailbone.api]
           extra_user_info = poser.web.api.util:extra_user_info

        Note that the above config assumes a simple *function* defined in your
        ``util`` module; such a function would look like e.g.::

           def extra_user_info(request, user, **info):
               # add favorite color
               info['favorite_color'] = 'green'
               # override display name
               info['display_name'] = "TODO"
