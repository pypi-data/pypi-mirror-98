Library for handling variable resolution in scalars found within strings and "tree"-like
data such as dict (internally), JSON/YAML content.

.. note::

    This is a Python 3 only library. There is no support for Python 2.x.

Overview
========

This is to support YAML settings files that may have embedded variable references in
scalar values that reference keys found within the same, or other content.

.. code-block:: python

    ROOT_DIR: "/var/log/my_project"

    LOG_FILENAME: "!ROOT_DIR!/my_log_file.log"

The use-cases for this include:

* Reducing redundancy in YAML data
* Support for "local overrides" to replace some data at run-time
* Support for tests where the content is changed (overloaded) for unit tests

Features
========

This library provides a number of features including:

* A ``TreeData`` class for easily loading files from JSON/YAML or from native ``dict`` objects
* Visitor base classes for inspecting/manipulating the tree data
* Support for specifying primary content, overload content, and variable content
* Both variable resolution at load time and dynamically at run-time
* A set of standard "resolvers"

Resolvers
---------

The library includes a set of standard resolvers. New resolvers can be defined
easily by extending the `Resolver` base class.

* `TreeDataResolver` - Resolution from a `TreeData` (dict) object/YAML files
* `DockerSwarmResolver` - Resolution from Docker swarm configs/secrets
* `EnvVarResolver` - Resolve from environment variables

Visitors
--------

The library includes a set of visitors for inspecting and updating `TreeData` objects.

Library Usage
=============

A service (both standard "system-d" and container services) may use this to handle settings.

Overview
--------

The settings are accessed via the `ServiceSettings` (or custom, extended class) Singleton. The
specifics of what actors are involved in providing the settings are specified within a
`SettingsContext` instance. These include the location of the primary settings file (generally
a YAML file), the location of an optional override settings file, and the inclusion of
resolvers for environment variables, Docker swarm secrets/configs, and any other optional
resolvers (such as pulling settings from a database).

Startup Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the first steps that a service should perform is creating an instance of the `SettingsContext`
object. This instance is passed into the ServiceSettings and provides contextual details
for loading the settings and resolving variables.
