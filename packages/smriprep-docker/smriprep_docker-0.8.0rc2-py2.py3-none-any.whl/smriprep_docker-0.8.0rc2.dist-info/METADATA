The sMRIPrep on Docker wrapper
------------------------------

sMRIprep is a structural magnetic resonance image pre-processing pipeline
that is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface
that is robust to differences in scan acquisition protocols and that requires
minimal user input, while providing easily interpretable and comprehensive
error and output reporting.

This is a lightweight Python wrapper to run sMRIPrep.
It generates the appropriate Docker commands, providing an intuitive interface
to running the sMRIPrep workflow in a Docker environment.
Docker must be installed and running. This can be checked
running ::
