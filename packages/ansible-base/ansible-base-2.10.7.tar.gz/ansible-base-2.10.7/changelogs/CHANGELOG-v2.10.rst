=======================================================

.. contents:: Topics


v2.10.7
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2021-03-15
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - Generation of an ``egg-info`` directory, if needed, is now done after installing test dependencies and before running tests. When running from an installed version of ``ansible-test`` a temporary directory is used to avoid permissions issues. Previously it was done before installing test dependencies and adjacent to the installed directory.
- ansible-test - now makes a better attempt to support podman when calling ``docker images`` and asking for JSON format.

Bugfixes
--------

- ConfigManager - Normalize ConfigParser between Python2 and Python3 to for handling comments (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73709)
- InventoryManager - Fix unhandled exception when given limit file was actually a directory.
- InventoryManager - Fix unhandled exception when inventory directory was empty or contained empty subdirectories (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73658).
- add AlmaLinux to fact gathering (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73458)
- ansible-galaxy - fixed galaxy role init command (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71977).
- ansible-inventory CLI - Deal with failures when sorting JSON and you have incompatible key types (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68950).
- ansible-test - Running tests using an installed version of ``ansible-test`` against one Python version from another no longer fails due to a missing ``egg-info`` directory. This could occur when testing plugins which import ``pkg_resources``.
- ansible-test - Running tests using an installed version of ``ansible-test`` no longer generates an error attempting to create an ``egg-info`` directory when an existing one is not found in the expected location. This could occur if the existing ``egg-info`` directory included a Python version specifier in the name.
- default callback - Ensure that the ``host_pinned`` strategy is not treated as lockstep (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73364)
- ensure find_mount_point consistently returns text.
- ensure we don't clobber role vars data when getting an empty file
- find module - Stop traversing directories past the requested depth. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73627)
- hostname - add Almalinux support (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73619)
- runtime routing - redirect ``firewalld`` to ``ansible.posix.firewalld`` FQCN (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73689).
- the unvault lookup plugin returned a byte string. Now returns a real string.
- yamllint - do not raise an ``AttributeError`` if a value is assigned to a module attribute at the top of the module.

v2.10.6
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2021-02-17

- ansible-test sanity changelog test - bump dependency on antsibull-changelog to 0.9.0 so that `fragments that add new plugins or objects <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/blob/main/docs/changelogs.rst#adding-new-roles-playbooks-test-and-filter-plugins>`_ will not fail validation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/73428).
- display correct error information when an error exists in the last line of the file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/16456)
- facts - properly report virtualization facts for Linux guests running on bhyve (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73167)
- git - Only pass ``--raw`` flag to git verify commands (verify-tag, verify-commit) when ``gpg_whitelist`` is in use. Otherwise don't pass it so that non-whitelist GPG validation still works on older Git versions. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64469)
- import_playbook - change warning about extra parameters to deprecation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72745)

- ansible-test validate-modules - no longer assume that ``default`` for ``type=bool`` options is ``false``, as the default is ``none`` and for some modules, ``none`` and ``false`` mean different things (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69561).
- iptables - reorder comment postition to be at the end (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71444).

Bugfixes
--------

- Adjust various hard-coded action names to also include their ``ansible.builtin.`` and ``ansible.legacy.`` prefixed version (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71817, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71818, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71824).

v2.10.3
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2020-11-02
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- ansible-test - Add a ``--docker-network`` option to choose the network for running containers when using the ``--docker`` option.
- ansible-test - Collections can now specify pip constraints for unit and integration test requirements using ``tests/unit/constraints.txt`` and ``tests/integration/constraints.txt`` respectively.
- ansible-test - python-cryptography is now bounded at <3.2, as 3.2 drops support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 upon which some of our CI infrastructure still depends.
- dnf - now shows specific package changes (installations/removals) under ``results`` in check_mode. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66132)

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- ansible-galaxy login command has been removed (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71560)

Bugfixes
--------

- Collection callbacks were ignoring options and rules for stdout and adhoc cases.
- Collections - Ensure ``action_loader.get`` is called with ``collection_list`` to properly find collections when ``collections:`` search is specified (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/72170)
- Fix ``RecursionError`` when templating large vars structures (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71920)
- ansible-doc - plugin option deprecations now also get ``collection_name`` added (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71735).
- ansible-test - Always connect additional Docker containers to the network used by the current container (if any).
- ansible-test - Always map ``/var/run/docker.sock`` into test containers created by the ``--docker`` option if the docker host is not ``localhost``.
- ansible-test - Attempt to detect the Docker hostname instead of assuming ``localhost``.
- ansible-test - Correctly detect running in a Docker container on Azure Pipelines.
- ansible-test - Prefer container IP at ``.NetworkSettings.Networks.{NetworkName}.IPAddress`` over ``.NetworkSettings.IPAddress``.
- ansible-test - The ``cs`` and ``openshift`` test plugins now search for containers on the current network instead of assuming the ``bridge`` network.
- ansible-test - Using the ``--remote`` option on Azure Pipelines now works from a job running in a container.
- async_wrapper - Fix race condition when ``~/.ansible_async`` folder tries to be created by multiple async tasks at the same time - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59306
- dnf - it is now possible to specify both ``security: true`` and ``bugfix: true`` to install updates of both types. Previously, only security would get installed if both were true. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70854)
- facts - fix distribution fact for SLES4SAP (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71559).
- is_string/vault - Ensure the is_string helper properly identifies AnsibleVaultEncryptedUnicode as a string (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71609)
- powershell - remove getting the PowerShell version from the env var ``POWERSHELL_VERSION``. This feature never worked properly and can cause conflicts with other libraries that use this var
- url lookup - make sure that options supplied in ansible.cfg are actually used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/71736).
- user - AnsibleModule.run_command returns a tuple of return code, stdout and stderr. The module main function of the user module expects user.create_user to return a tuple of return code, stdout and stderr. Fix the locations where stdout and stderr got reversed.
- user - Local users with an expiry date cannot be created as the ``luseradd`` / ``lusermod`` commands do not support the ``-e`` option. Set the expiry time in this case via ``lchage`` after the user was created / modified. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71942)

| Release Date: 2020-09-14
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Minor Changes
-------------

- The fix for CVE-2020-1736 has been reverted. Users are encouraged to specify a ``mode`` parameter in their file-based tasks when the files being manipulated contain sensitive data.
- dnf - Previously, regardless of the ``disable_gpg_check`` option, packages were not GPG validated. They are now. (CVE-2020-14365)

v2.10.0
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2020-08-13
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html>`__


Major Changes
-------------

- Both ansible-doc and ansible-console's help command will error for modules and plugins whose return documentation cannot be parsed as YAML. All modules and plugins passing ``ansible-test sanity --test yamllint`` will not be affected by this.
- Collections may declare a list of supported/tested Ansible versions for the collection. A warning is issued if a collection does not support the Ansible version that loads it (can also be configured as silent or a fatal error). Collections that do not declare supported Ansible versions do not issue a warning/error.
- Plugin routing allows collections to declare deprecation, redirection targets, and removals for all plugin types.
- Plugins that import module_utils and other ansible namespaces that have moved to collections should continue to work unmodified.
- Routing data built into Ansible 2.10 ensures that 2.9 content should work unmodified on 2.10. Formerly included modules and plugins that were moved to collections are still accessible by their original unqualified names, so long as their destination collections are installed.
- When deprecations are done in code, they to specify a ``collection_name`` so that deprecation warnings can mention which collection - or ansible-base - is deprecating a feature. This affects all ``Display.deprecated()`` or ``AnsibleModule.deprecate()`` or ``Ansible.Basic.Deprecate()`` calls, and ``removed_in_version``/``removed_at_date`` or ``deprecated_aliases`` in module argument specs.
- ansible-test now uses a different ``default`` test container for Ansible Collections

Minor Changes
-------------

- 'Edit on GitHub' link for plugin, cli documentation fixed to navigate to correct plugin, cli source.
- Add 'auth_url' field to galaxy server config stanzas in ansible.cfg The url should point to the token_endpoint of a Keycloak server.
- Add --ask-vault-password and --vault-pass-file options to ansible cli commands
- Add ``--pre`` flag to ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` to allow pulling in the most recent pre-release version of a collection (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64905)
- Add a global toggle to control when vars plugins are executed (per task by default for backward compatibility or after importing inventory).
- Add a new config parameter, WIN_ASYNC_STARTUP_TIMEOUT, which allows configuration of the named pipe connection timeout under Windows when launching async tasks.
- Add a per-plugin stage option to override the global toggle to control the execution of individual vars plugins (per task, after inventory, or both).
- Add an additional check for importing journal from systemd-python module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/60595).
- Add an example for using var in with_sequence (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68836).
- Add new magic variable ``ansible_collection`` that contains the collection name
- Add new magic variable ``ansible_role_name`` that contains the FQCN of the role
- Add standard Python 2/3 compatibility boilerplate to setup script, module_utils and docs_fragments which were missing them.
- Added PopOS as a part of Debian OS distribution family (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69286).
- Added hostname support for PopOS in hostname module.
- Added openEuler OS in RedHat OS Family.

- Ansible CLI fails with warning if extra_vars parameter is used with filename without @ sign (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/51857).
- Ansible modules created with ``add_file_common_args=True`` added a number of undocumented arguments which were mostly there to ease implementing certain action plugins. The undocumented arguments ``src``, ``follow``, ``force``, ``content``, ``backup``, ``remote_src``, ``regexp``, ``delimiter``, and ``directory_mode`` are now no longer added. Modules relying on these options to be added need to specify them by themselves. Also, action plugins relying on these extra elements in ``FILE_COMMON_ARGUMENTS`` need to be adjusted.
- Ansible now allows deprecation by date instead of deprecation by version. This is possible for plugins and modules (``meta/runtime.yml`` and ``deprecated.removed_at_date`` in ``DOCUMENTATION``, instead of ``deprecated.removed_in``), for plugin options (``deprecated.date`` instead of ``deprecated.version`` in ``DOCUMENTATION``), for module options (``removed_at_date`` instead of ``removed_in_version`` in argument spec), and for module option aliases (``deprecated_aliases.date`` instead of ``deprecated_aliases.version`` in argument spec).
- Ansible should fail with error when non-existing limit file is provided in command line.
- Ansible.Basic - Added the ability to specify multiple fragments to load in a generic way for modules that use a module_util with fragment options

- Remove the deprecation message for the ``TRANSFORM_INVALID_GROUP_CHARS`` setting. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61889)
- Removed extras_require support from setup.py (and [azure] extra). Requirements will float with the collections, so it's not appropriate for ansible-base to host requirements for them any longer.
- Simplify dict2items filter example in loop documentation (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65505).
- Templating - Add globals to the jinja2 environment at ``Templar`` instantiation, instead of customizing the template object. Only customize the template object, to disable lookups. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69278)
- Templating - Add support to auto unroll generators produced by jinja2 filters, to prevent the need of explicit use of ``|list`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/68014)
- The plugin loader now keeps track of the collection where a plugin was resolved to, in particular whether the plugin was loaded from ansible-base's internal paths (``ansible.builtin``) or from user-supplied paths (no collection name).
- The results queue and counter for results are now split for standard / handler results. This allows the governing strategy to be truly independent from the handler strategy, which basically follows the linear methodology.
- Update required library message with correct grammer in basic.py.
- Updated inventory script location for EC2, Openstack, and Cobbler after collection (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68897).
- Updated inventory script location for infoblox, ec2 and other after collection migration (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69139).

- ansible-doc - return values will be properly formatted (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69796).
- ansible-galaxy - Add ``download`` option for ``ansible-galaxy collection`` to download collections and their dependencies for an offline install
- ansible-galaxy - Add a `verify` subcommand to `ansible-galaxy collection`. The collection found on the galaxy server is downloaded to a tempfile to compare the checksums of the files listed in the MANIFEST.json and the FILES.json with the contents of the installed collection.

Security Fixes
--------------

- **security issue** - Convert CLI provided passwords to text initially, to prevent unsafe context being lost when converting from bytes->text during post processing of PlayContext. This prevents CLI provided passwords from being incorrectly templated (CVE-2019-14856)
- **security issue** - Redact cloud plugin secrets in ansible-test when running integration tests using cloud plugins. Only present in 2.9.0b1.
- **security issue** - TaskExecutor - Ensure we don't erase unsafe context in TaskExecutor.run on bytes. Only present in 2.9.0beta1 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/62237)
- **security issue** - The ``subversion`` module provided the password via the svn command line option ``--password`` and can be retrieved from the host's /proc/<pid>/cmdline file. Update the module to use the secure ``--password-from-stdin`` option instead, and add a warning in the module and in the documentation if svn version is too old to support it. (CVE-2020-1739)
- **security issue** - Update ``AnsibleUnsafeText`` and ``AnsibleUnsafeBytes`` to maintain unsafe context by overriding ``.encode`` and ``.decode``. This prevents future issues with ``to_text``, ``to_bytes``, or ``to_native`` removing the unsafe wrapper when converting between string types (CVE-2019-14856)
- **security issue** - properly hide parameters marked with ``no_log`` in suboptions when invalid parameters are passed to the module (CVE-2019-14858)
- **security issue** atomic_move - change default permissions when creating temporary files so they are not world readable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67794) (CVE-2020-1736)
- **security issue** win_unzip - normalize paths in archive to ensure extracted files do not escape from the target directory (CVE-2020-1737)
- **security_issue** - create temporary vault file with strict permissions when editing and prevent race condition (CVE-2020-1740)
- Ensure we get an error when creating a remote tmp if it already exists. CVE-2020-1733
- In fetch action, avoid using slurp return to set up dest, also ensure no dir traversal CVE-2020-1735.
- Sanitize no_log values from any response keys that might be returned from the uri module (CVE-2020-14330).
- ansible-galaxy - Error when install finds a tar with a file that will be extracted outside the collection install directory - CVE-2020-10691

Bugfixes
--------

- ActionBase - Add new ``cleanup`` method that is explicitly run by the ``TaskExecutor`` to ensure that the shell plugins ``tmpdir`` is always removed. This change means that individual action plugins need not be responsible for removing the temporary directory, which ensures that we don't have code paths that accidentally leave behind the temporary directory.
- Add example setting for ``collections_paths`` parameter to ``examples/ansible.cfg``
- Add missing gcp modules to gcp module defaults group
- Added support for Flatcar Container Linux in distribution and hostname modules. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/69627)
- Added support for OSMC distro in hostname module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66189).
- Address compat with rpmfluff-0.6 for integration tests
- Address the deprecation of the use of stdlib distutils in packaging. It's a short-term hotfix for the problem (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70456, https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2230, https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/commit/bd110264)
- Allow TypeErrors on Undefined variables in filters to be handled or deferred when processing for loops.
- Allow tasks to notify a fqcn handler name (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/68181)
- An invalid value is hard to track down if you don't know where it came from, return field name instead.

- AnsibleDumper - Add a representer for AnsibleUnsafeBytes (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/62562).
- AnsibleModule.run_command() - set ``close_fds`` to ``False`` on Python 2 if ``pass_fds`` are passed to ``run_command()``. Since ``subprocess.Popen()`` on Python 2 does not have the ``pass_fds`` option, there is no way to exclude a specific list of file descriptors from being closed.
- Avoid bare select() for running commands to avoid too large file descriptor numbers failing tasks
- Avoid running subfunctions that are passed to show_vars function when it will be a noop.
- By passing the module_tmpdir as a parameter in the write_ssh_wrapper function instead of initalizing module_tmpdir via get_module_path()
- CLI - the `ANSIBLE_PLAYBOOK_DIR` envvar or `playbook_dir` config can now substitute for the --playbook-dir arg on CLIs that support it (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59464)
- Check NoneType for raw_params before proceeding in include_vars (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64939).
- Collections - Allow a collection role to call a stand alone role, without needing to explicitly add ``ansible.legacy`` to the collection search order within the collection role. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69101)
- Correctly process raw_params in add_hosts.
- Create an ``import_module`` compat util, for use across the codebase, to allow collection loading to work properly on Python26

- Ensure that keywords defined as booleans are correctly interpreting their input, before patch any random string would be interpreted as False
- Ensure we don't allow ansible_facts subkey of ansible_facts to override top level, also fix 'deprefixing' to prevent key transforms.
- Fact Delegation - Add ability to indicate which facts must always be delegated. Primarily for ``discovered_interpreter_python`` right now, but extensible later. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/61002)
- Fix ``delegate_facts: true`` when ``ansible_python_interpreter`` is not set. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/70168)
- Fix a bug when a host was not removed from a play after ``meta: end_host`` and as a result the host was still present in ``ansible_play_hosts`` and ``ansible_play_batch`` variables.
