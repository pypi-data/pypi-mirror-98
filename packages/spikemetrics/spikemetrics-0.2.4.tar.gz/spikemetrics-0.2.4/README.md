# SpikeMetrics
Computes quality metrics for sorted units. This module can calculate metrics separately for individual epochs. If no epochs are specified, metrics are computed for the entire recording.

The base code (and portions of the README images/description) was ported from: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ecephys_spike_sorting/tree/master/ecephys_spike_sorting/modules/quality_metrics

### A Note on Calculations

For metrics based on waveform principal components (isolation distance, L-ratio, _d'_, and nearest neighbors hit rate and false alarm rate), it is typical to compute the metrics for all pairs of units and report the "worst-case" value. We have found that this tends to under- or over-estimate the degree of contamination when there are large firing rate differences between pairs of units that are being compared. Instead, we compute metrics by sub-selecting spikes from _all_ other units on the same set of channels, which seems to give a more accurate picture of isolation quality. We would appreciate feedback on whether this approach makes sense.
