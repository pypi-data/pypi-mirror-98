Contributing
============

We appreciate your contributions! Because this is an open source project, we want to keep it as easy
as possible to contribute changes. However, we need contributors to follow a few guidelines.


## Coding style

Contributed source code must follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style
conventions.

Other formatting requirements:
- 4 space indents, no tabs are allowed.
- No trailing whitespace.
- All source files must end with a newline (an empty line at the end).
- Lines should generally not be longer than 120 characters, though this is not a hard rule. Overall readability
  is more important.


## Process

Before you submit your changes, please ensure that:

- The code meets style requirements listed above.
- You have added your copyright below existing copyrights in the files you modified. New files should have only
  your copyright. See the License section below for more.
- Changes have been tested locally to the extent possible. (Obviously, we don't expect you to have as many
  test boards as we do.)
- Your code works with both Python 2 and Python 3.

Please create a pull request in GitHub with your contribution. Before creating the pull request,
please ensure that all tests pass. We also run the tests on a wide range of boards for every pull
request using our CI setup. Changes must pass on all tested boards before the the pull request can
be merged.

The [developers' guide](docs/developers_guide.md) describes how to create your development
environment. The [automated tests guide](docs/automated_tests.md) provides information about the
available types of tests and describes how to run the tests.


## License

By creating a pull request on GitHub, you are granting license your contributions under the same Apache 2.0
license as the originalâ€¯code. However, the copyright on contributions is retained by their author(s). Please
add your copyright below existing copyrights in the license header at the top of the source file. If you are
doing the work for your employer, you should use your employer's copyright. If a file is newly added by you,
it must contain the standard license header with your copyright. Please note that we do not list changes in
each source file by copyright owner, as this becomes a burden to maintain.

Contributing source code that is already licensed using a license other than Apache 2.0 is possible, but each
case must be considered individually. (If you are the owner of the source code, then you have the right to
relicense to Apache 2.0.) The most important thing is that the license is compatible with Apache 2.0. Examples
are MIT, the BSD licenses, and similar. GPL-licensed code is expressly disallowed to be contributed, as the
GPL is not compatible with Apache 2.0 (or any of the Apache-compatible licenses).
