        Covid Resilience :
        
        The first purpose of the package is, given a list of stock tickers is to state what are the most covid resilient stocks and what are the worst ones.
        It computes a very simple score based on the volatility and return of the stocks over different periods.
        
        
        CovidResilience(stock_index = "STOXX 600", start_date = None, end_date = None, tickers = None)
        
        
        Input: 
        
        - stock_index : benchmark  (example : "CAC 40","S&P 500", "STOXX 600")
        - start_date, end_date : strings, format "YYYY-MM-DD"
        - tickers : list of tickers
        ex : CovidResilience("STOXX 600","2020-01-19", "2021-01-19", tickers = list_of_tickers)
        
        
        Output:
        
        - .relevant_data
        - .relevant_data_returns
        - .volatilities
        - .rslt
        
        
        Example (copy/paste):
        
        !pip install FINANCEPP
        
        from finance import covidresilient as cr
        
        list_of_tickers = ["FP.PA","MC.PA","AI.PA","OR.PA", "RI.PA","AIR.PA"]
        
        covidfilter = cr.CovidResilience("CAC 40","2020-01-19", "2021-01-19", tickers = list_of_tickers)
        
        covidfilter.run()
        
        covidfilter.rslt
