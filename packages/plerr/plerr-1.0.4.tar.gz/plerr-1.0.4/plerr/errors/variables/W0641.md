## W0641 (possibly-unused-variable)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Used when a variable is defined but might not be used. The possibility comes
from the fact that `locals()` might be used, which could consume or not the
said variable.
