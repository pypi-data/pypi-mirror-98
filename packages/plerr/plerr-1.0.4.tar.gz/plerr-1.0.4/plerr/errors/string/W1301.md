## W1301 (unused-format-string-key)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Used when a format string that uses named conversion specifiers is used with
a dictionary that contains keys not required by the format string.
