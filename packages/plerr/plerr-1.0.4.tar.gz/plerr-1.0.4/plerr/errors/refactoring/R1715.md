## R1715 (consider-using-get)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Using the builtin `dict.get` for getting a value from a dictionary if a key is
present or a default if not, is simpler and considered more idiomatic,
although sometimes a bit slower.
