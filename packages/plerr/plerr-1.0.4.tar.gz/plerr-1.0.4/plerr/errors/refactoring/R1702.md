## R1702 (too-many-nested-blocks)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### Rationale:

Used when a function or a method has too many nested blocks. This makes the
code less understandable and maintainable. Maximum number of nested blocks
for function / method body is 5 by default.
