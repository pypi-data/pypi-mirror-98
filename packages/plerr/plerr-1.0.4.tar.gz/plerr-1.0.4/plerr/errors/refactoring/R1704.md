## R1704 (redefined-argument-from-local)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Used when a local name is redefining an argument, which might suggest a
potential error. This is taken in account only for a handful of name binding
operations, such as for iteration, with statement assignment and exception
handler assignment.
