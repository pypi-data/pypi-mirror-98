## R1718 (consider-using-set-comprehension)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to
read and can be simplified to a set comprehension. Also it is faster since you
don't need to create another transient list.
