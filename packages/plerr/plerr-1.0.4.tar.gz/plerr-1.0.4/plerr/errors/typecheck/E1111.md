## E1111 (assignment-from-no-return)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo(x, y):
    z = x + y


value = foo(10, 10)
print(value)
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo(x, y):
    return x + y


value = foo(10, 10)
print(value)
```

### Rationale:

Used when an assignment is done on a function call but the inferred function
doesn't return anything.
