## E1121 (too-many-function-args)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Used when a function call passes too many positional arguments.
Maximum number of arguments for function / method is 5 by default.
