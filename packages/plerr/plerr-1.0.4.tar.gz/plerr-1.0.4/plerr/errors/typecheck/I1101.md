## I1101 (c-extension-no-member)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Used when a variable is accessed for non-existent member of C extension. Due
to unavailability of source static analysis is impossible, but it may be
performed by introspecting living objects in run-time.
