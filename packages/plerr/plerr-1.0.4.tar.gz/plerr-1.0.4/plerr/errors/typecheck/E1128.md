## E1128 (assignment-from-none)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
def foo():
    return None


f = foo()
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
def foo():
    return None


f = foo() if foo() else 1
```

### Rationale:

Used when an assignment is done on a function call but the inferred function
returns nothing but `None`.
