## W0126 (missing-parentheses-for-call-in-test)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) seems to wrongly call
a function due to missing parentheses.
