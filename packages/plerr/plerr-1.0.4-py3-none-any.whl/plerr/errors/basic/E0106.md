## E0106 (return-arg-in-generator)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Used when a `return` statement with an argument is found outside in a
generator function or method (e.g. with some `yield` statements). It can't be
emitted when using Python >= 3.3.
