## R1721 (unnecessary-comprehension)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Instead of using an identitiy comprehension, consider using the `list`, `dict`
or `set` constructor. It is faster and simpler.
