## W0715 (raising-format-tuple)

### :x: Problematic code:

```python
# to be addded
```

### :heavy_check_mark: Correct code:

```python
# to be added
```

### Rationale:

Used when passing multiple arguments to an exception constructor, the first
of them a string literal containing what appears to be placeholders intended
for formatting.
