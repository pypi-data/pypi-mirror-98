Description: # Starter-Flask
        ## _Build Flask Project Faster_
        
        **Starter-Flask** allows you to create python flask app simply and quickly.
        The project is pretty straight-forward. With a single line, a basic app will be up and running.
        
        *Built with [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/) package.*
        ## Getting Started
        First, create a virtual environment.
        ```sh
        virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        // or venv\Scripts\activate for Windows
        ```
        Then, install *starter-flask*.
        ```sh
        pip install starter-flask
        ```
        The command **starter-flask** is now available. Create your project like so :
        ```sh
         starter-flask -p <your_project_name>
        ```
        Finally, jump into your fresh new folder and run it.
        ```sh
         cd <your_project_name> && flask run
        ```
        ## Features
        - Flask
        - Flask-Blueprint
        - Flask-Login
        - Flask-Migrate
        - Flask-SQLAlchemy
        - psycopg2-binary
        - gunicorn
        
        As you can see the project is PostgreSQL oriented. Feel free to install the database's adapter of your choice.
        ## Project Layout
        The project tries to follow [Application Factories](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/appfactories/) best practices. It comes with project layout following factory's guideline and blueprint views. 
        
        
        ## Future Improvements
        - Possibility to add new blueprint with cli
        - Redis & Celery supports
        - Possibility to create an API oriented project
        - ... feel free to email ideas
