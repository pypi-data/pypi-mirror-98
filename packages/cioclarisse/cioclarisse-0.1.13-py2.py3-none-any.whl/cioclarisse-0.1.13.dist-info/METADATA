# Conductor for Clarisse

Clarisse Scripted Class submitter for the Conductor Cloud rendering service.

## Install


**To install the latest version.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade cioclarisse --target=$HOME/Conductor
```

**To install a specific version, for example 0.1.0.**
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall cioclarisse==0.1.0 --target=$HOME/Conductor
```
**Then tell Clarisse how to find the plugin on startup.** 

Set the following path in the Startup Script section of the preferences window.

```bash
$CIO_DIR/cioclarisse/startup.py
```


## Usage

Right mouse click on a browser window and choose New->ConductorJob.

For detailed help, checkout the [tutorial](https://docs.conductortech.com/tutorials/clarisse) and [reference](https://docs.conductortech.com/reference/clarisse) documentation.

## Contributing


Clone the repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:ConductorTechnologies/cioclarisse.git
cd cioclarisse
```

Set up a clean virtual envirionment with Python 2.7 for development (optional).

```
python -m virtualenv venv
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install development dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

Build and install from this directory into to a convenient location for testing.
```

pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt --target=$HOME/ConductorStaging

python $HOME/ConductorStaging/cioclarisse/post_install.py
```

When you install from the file requirements.txt, the dependency on ciocore is specified as a local sibling of this project, meaning you can develop ciocore and cioclarisse in parallel.

The post_install.py script writes a variable CIO_DIR into Clarisse env files in the standard Clarisse prefs location. This allows you to use that variable in Cklarisse's startup panel to register the Conductor plugin. Check the output of the command for more info.

## OLD CHANGELOG

### Version:v2.11.7 -  2019.12.09

*  Fixed bug where empty config.yaml could not be parsed.

### Version:v2.11.6 -  2019.11.30

* Better detection of windows paths to be replaced. Less chance of false positives.

### Version:v2.11.5 -  2019.11.25

* Path manipulation code now runs on Windows only.

### Version:v2.11.4 -  2019.11.19


* Now handles windows path management offline by replacing paths in project files. In some situations links to resources in files with nested references could get erased while loading a project if all the references are not resolved. For this reason, its not sufficient to replace the paths in the session with the clarrisse sdk. Paths must be valid before the project loads. 
* Fixed bug where render file would be cleaned up before the upload daemon had a chance to upload it.

### Version:v2.11.3  -  2019.11.14

* Catch invalid glob path that caused Clarisse to crash.

### Version:v2.10.1  -  2019.09.26

* Submitter title defaults to $PNAME.
* Images attribute changed to images_and_layers.
* Instance types menu entries are now ordered by machine spec.
* Pre render script replaces backslashes as well as drive letters.
* Better error on failure to make subdirectories.

### Version:v2.9.1  -  2019.08.30

*  Supports rendering of individual image layers without rendering the containing image.
*  You can proceed with a render if some dependencies are missing. You are shown a list of missing files first. Offending files are removed from the upload list, which would previously cause a submission failure.
*  Supports shipping of the clarisse.cfg file so that preferences such as "output AOV to separate files" are respected. It has been necessary to strip some UI-focused categories to avoid a crash on Windows.
*  Choose between localizing contexts, or shipping the job with nested xrefs in tact. Due to a bug in the Clarisse undo mechanism after localizing contexts, the only way to restore the project previously was to reload a saved backup after submitting. Now we can handle shipping xrefs, there's no need to modify the scene before submission and therefore the whole operation is faster.
*  `<angle bracket tokens>` are now used to build the task command. The previous release used Clarisse `$VARIABLES` which could be confusing and less robust.
*  Some CLI args, like -license_server, -config_file, and -debug_level, have been moved into the wrapper in order to keep the task command clean. They are implemented as default values that make sense for submissions to the cloud, but can be overridden b,y including them in the task template.
*  Dependency scanning now has improved handling and information display when badly formed paths are encountered.
* Render package: Ship a regular project ASCII file to Conductor, in favour of the now deprecated render package binary.
*   Removed the over-complicated tree view widget for software package selection in favor of a dropdown menu.
*   If several images or layers are being rendered to different locations, we determine the writable output as the common location among them. If this path turns out to be the root path, it is considered invalid.
