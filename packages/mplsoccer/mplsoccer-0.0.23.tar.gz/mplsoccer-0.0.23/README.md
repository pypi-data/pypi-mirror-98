# mplsoccer

mplsoccer is a Python library for drawing soccer/football pitches in Matplotlib and loading StatsBomb open-data.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install mplsoccer.

```bash
pip install mplsoccer
```

## Docs

Here are the [docs](https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/) for mplsoccer.

## Quick start

Plot a StatsBomb pitch

```python
from mplsoccer.pitch import Pitch
pitch = Pitch(pitch_color='grass', line_color='white', stripe=True)
fig, ax = pitch.draw()
```

## Why mplsoccer exists

mplsoccer shares some of the tools I built for the OptaPro Analytics Forum.
At the time there weren’t any open-sourced python tools. Now alternatives exist, such as [matplotsoccer](https://pypi.org/project/matplotsoccer/).

By using mplsoccer, I hope that you can spend more time building insightful graphics rather than having to learn to draw pitches from scratch.


## Advantages of mplsoccer

mplsoccer:

1. draws 7 different pitch types by changing a single argument, which is useful as there isn’t a standardised data format
2. extends matplotlib to plot heatmaps, (comet) lines, footballs and rotated markers
3. flips the data coordinates when in a vertical orientation so you don’t need to remember to flip them
4. creates tidy dataframes for StatsBomb data, which is useful as most of the alternatives produce nested dataframes

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome. It would be great to add the following functionality to mplsoccer:
- pass maps
- pass sonars

Examples to help others are also welcome for a gallery.

## Inspiration

mplsoccer was inspired by other people's work:
- [Peter McKeever](http://petermckeever.com/2019/01/plotting-pitches-in-python/) inspired the API design
- [ggsoccer](https://github.com/Torvaney/ggsoccer) - a library for plotting pitches in R
- [lastrow](https://twitter.com/lastrowview) - often tweets animations from matches and the accompanying code
- [fcrstats](http://fcrstats.com/) - tutorials for using football data
- [fcpython](https://fcpython.com/) - Python tutorials for using football data
- [Karun Singh](https://twitter.com/karun1710) - tweets some interesting football analytics and visuals
- [StatsBomb](https://statsbomb.com/) - great visual design and free open-data
- John Burn-Murdoch's [tweet](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1057907312030085120) got me interested in football analytics
