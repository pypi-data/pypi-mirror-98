Product
=======

Product is what links all fdi components together.

Data and Meta Data
-------------------

.. image:: ../_static/product.png
   :width: 30%
		   
A product has
   * zero or more datasets: defining well described data entities (say images, tables, spectra etc...). 
   * accompanying meta data -- required information such as

     * who created this product,
     * what does the data reflect (say measurement from an instrument)
     * and so on;
   * possible additional meta data specific to that particular product type.
   * history of this product: how was this data created.

     
History
-------

The history is a lightweight mechanism to record the origin of this product or changes made to this product. Lightweight means, that the Product data itself does not  records changes, but external parties can attach additional information to the Product which reflects the changes.

The sole purpose of the history interface of a Product is to allow notably pipeline tasks (as defined by the pipeline framework) to record what they have done to generate and/or modify a Product. 

Serializable
---------------

In order to transfer data across the network between heterogeneous nodes data needs to be serializable.
JSON format is used considering to transfer serialized data for its wide adoption, availability of tools, ease to use with Python, and simplicity.


Defining Products
-----------------

     A number of built-in Parameters can be specified in ``fdi/dataset/resourcese`` in YAML format. A helper utility ``yaml2python`` can be run using ``make py`` to generate test-ready Python code of product class module containing the built-ins.

BaseProduct
"""""""""""

This is the definition file `BaseProduct.yml`

.. include:: ../../../fdi/dataset/resources/BaseProduct.yml
   :code: yaml

The preamble key-value pairs give information about this definition:

:name:  of this product
:description: -- Information about this product
:parents: -- Children products Inherit parentâ€™s metadata
:level: Applicable Level
:schema: version of format of this YAML document

From the creation process requires every product to carry the following metadata entries about itself, 

:description: (Also in native language if it is not English.)
:type: -- In software or business domain
:version: -- Products of the same format must be versioned, configuration controlled, and be ready to deal with version differences between inputs , algorithms, software and pipelines.
:FORMATV: -- Version of this document with Schema information, e.g. 1.4.1.2
:creator, rootCause, creationDate: -- Who, why, when, where


Examples (from :doc:`quickstart` page):

.. include:: quickstart.rst
   :start-after: Product with metadata and datasets
   :end-before: pal - Product Access Layer
