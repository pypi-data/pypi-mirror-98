    About_URN

The Universial Resource Name (**URN**) string has this format:

        urn:<poolname>:<resourcetype>:<serialnumber>

where

:<poolname>: A (optionally path-like) string, also called poolID. Its format is the same as a file directory name, without leading or trailing ``/``.
:<resourcetype>: class name of the data item (usually :class:`Product`)
:<serialnumber>: internal index for a certain <resourcetype>.

The ``poolname`` in a URN is a label. Although pool creator could use '/' in it to introduce internal heirachy. Some examples:

-  urn:pool_mh:fdi.dataset.product.Product:2
-  urn:newdata/2020:svom.products.SVOMMapContext:0

Storage Pools (subclasses of :class:`ProductPool`) are where data item reside. The **PoolURL** is used to give practical information of a pool, such as a poolname, its location, and its access scheme. It is designed to be a local set-up detail that is supposed to be hidden from pool users. Data processing software use ``URN``s to refer to products, without specifying pool location. The poolID in a URN could be a :class:`LocalPool` on the development laptop and a :class:`HTTPClientPool` on the production cloud.

    About_poolURL

The ``PoolURL`` format is in the form of a URL that preceeds its poolname part:

                 <scheme>://<place><poolpath>/<poolname>

:<scheme>: Implementation protocol including ``file`` for :class:`LocalPool`, ``mem`` for :class:`MemPool`, ``http``, ``https`` for :class:`HttpclientPool`.
:<place>: IP:port such as``192.168.5.6:8080`` for ``http`` and ``https`` schemes, or an empty string for ``file`` and ``mem`` schemes.
:<poolname>: same as in URN.
:<poolpath>: The part between ``place`` and an optional ``poolhint``::

- For ``file`` or ``server`` schemes, e.g. it is ``/c:/tmp`` in ``http://localhost:9000/c:/tmp/mypool/`` with ``poolhint`` keyword arguement of :func:`parse_poolurl` not given, or given as ``mypool`` (or ``myp`` or ``my`` ...).
- For ``http`` and ``https`` schemes, it is e.g. ``/0.6/tmp`` in ``https://10.0.0.114:5000/v0.6/tmp/mypool`` with ``poolhint`` keyword arguement not given, or given as ``mypool`` (or ``myp` or 'my' ...). The meaning of poolpath is subject to interpretation by the  server. In the preceeding example the poolpath has an API version.  :meth:`ProductPool.transformpath` is used to map it further. Note that trailing blank and ``/`` are ignored, and stripped in the output.

Examples:

-  file:///tmp/mydata for pool ```mydata```
-  file:///d:/data/test2/v2 for pool ``test2/v2``
-  mem:///dummy for pool ``dummy``
-  https://10.0.0.114:5000/v0.6/obs for a httpclientpool ``obs``
-  server:///tmp/data/0.4/test for a httppool ``test`` used on a server.
