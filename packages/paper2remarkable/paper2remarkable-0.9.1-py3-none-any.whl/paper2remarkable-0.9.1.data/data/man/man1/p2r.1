.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Fetch an academic paper, local pdf file, or any web article and send it to the
reMarkable tablet. The input to the script can be a URL to a PDF file or
article on a website, or a local file. For supported scientific outlets, the
program will collect the metadata for the paper and create a nice filename
(unless \fB\-\-filename\fP is specified). See \fI\%SUPPORTED
SOURCES\fP for an overview of supported scientific paper
sources.
.sp
By default, paper2remarkable crops the unnecessary whitespace from a PDF file
to make the paper fit better on the reMarkable. The default setting yields a
left\-aligned document on the reMarkable which can be useful for taking margin
notes. Alternatively, the program supports the \fB\-\-center\fP, \fB\-\-right\fP, and
\fB\-\-no\-crop\fP options to change this crop setting.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Basic options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b\fP,\fB  \-\-blank
Add a blank page after every page of the PDF document. This can be
useful for taking notes on papers.
.TP
.BI \-C\fP,\fB  \-\-config\fB= FILENAME
Read options from a configuration file. A YAML file is supported, see
\fI\%CONFIGURATION FILE\fP for further details. By default the
file at \fB~/.paper2remarkable.yml\fP is used if it exists.
.TP
.B \-e\fP,\fB  \-\-experimental
Enable the experimental features of paper2remarkable. See below under
\fI\%EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES\fP for an overview.
.TP
.BI \-f\fP,\fB  \-\-filename\fB= FILENAME
Filename to use for the file on reMarkable. If you specify multiple
\fBINPUT\fP files and want to use a specific filename for each, you can
specify \fB\-\-filename\fP for each \fBINPUT\fP source by repeating it.
.TP
.B \-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help
Show help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-v\fP,\fB  \-\-verbose
Enable verbose mode of paper2remarkable. By default the program prints
no output.
.TP
.B \-V\fP,\fB  \-\-version
Show the version and exit.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Crop options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c\fP,\fB  \-\-center
Center the PDF on the page.
.TP
.B \-k\fP,\fB  \-\-no\-crop
Don\(aqt crop the document at all.
.TP
.B \-r\fP,\fB  \-\-right
Right\-align the document on the reMarkable so the menu doesn\(aqt cover it.
.UNINDENT
.sp
reMarkable options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-n\fP,\fB  \-\-no\-upload
Don\(aqt upload the document to the reMarkable, save the output in the
current working directory.
.TP
.BI \-p\fP,\fB  \-\-remarkable\-path\fB= DIR
The directory on the reMarkable where the document will be uploaded to.
If the target directory does not exist it will be created. If not
specified, the root directory will be used.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Output customization:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-css\fB= FILENAME
Path to a CSS file with custom styling for the HTML output. This option
is ignored for any of the other providers. The code for the HTML
provider contains the default CSS style, which can be used as a starting
point.
.TP
.BI \-\-font\-urls\fB= FILENAME
Path to a file with font urls (one per line) for the HTML output. This
will generally be used in combination with the \fB\-\-css\fP option.
.UNINDENT
.sp
System settings:
.sp
You\(aqll only need to specify these options if the programs are not available on
the PATH variable.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-gs\fB= GS
Path to the GhostScript executable.
.TP
.BI \-\-pdftoppm\fB= PDFTOPPM
Path to pdftoppm executable (default: pdftoppm). Note that pdftoppm is
optional.
.TP
.BI \-\-pdftk\fB= PDFTK
Path to PDFtk executable (default: pdftk). Either pdftk or qpdf is
needed.
.TP
.BI \-\-qpdf\fB= QPDF
Path to qpdf executable (default: qpdf). Either pdftk or qpdf is needed.
.TP
.BI \-\-rmapi\fB= RMAPI
Path to rmapi executable (default: rmapi).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Developer options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d\fP,\fB  \-\-debug
Debug mode, when used the program doesn\(aqt upload the document to the
reMarkable by default and leaves the temporary directory with
intermediate files.

.SH SUPPORTED SOURCES
.sp
The following scientific sources are currently supported and paper2remarkable
will create a filename based on the authors, title, and publication year of
the work. For the sources below the program is generally flexible with regards
to whether a URL to the PDF or to the abstract page is provided.

paper2remarkable also supports a generic URL to a PDF file or a local file, in
which case no "nice" filename will be generated.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A generic URL to a PDF file. This can be considered a fallback option for
when a PDF source is not supported (yet).
.IP \(bu 2
A local PDF file.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, paper2remarkable supports extracting articles from websites. In this
case an effort is done to detect the main content of the article and clean up
the HTML before sending the file to the reMarkable.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.sp
To avoid having to provide frequently\-used command line flags, a configuration
file can be created for paper2remarkable. By default it is a YAML file located
at \fB~/.paper2remarkable.yml\fP, but an alternative location can be provided
with the \fB\-\-config\fP option to the script.
.sp
The configuration file consists of three sections: \fBcore\fP, \fBsystem\fP, and
\fBhtml\fP\&. In the \fBcore\fP section options for cropping, verbosity, and blank
pages can be added, among others. The \fBsystem\fP section allows setting paths
to executables such as \fBrmapi\fP, \fBpdftk\fP, etc.  Finally, the \fBhtml\fP
section allows you to provide custom CSS and font urls for formatting the
output of web articles.
.sp
Options provided on the command line overwrite those in the configuration
file. So, for instance, if the configuration file has the setting \fBcrop:
\(aqleft\(aq\fP in the \fBcore\fP section and the command line flag \fB\-c\fP is provided,
the PDF will be centered.
.sp
An example file is provided in the repository on
\fI\%GitHub\fP, which also
contains more information on the available options and their values.
.SH EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
.sp
Occassionally, experimental (beta) features will be included in
paper2remarkable and they will be listed here. You can enable the experimental
features by using the \fB\-e\fP flag to paper2remarkable.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
The HTML provider currently has an experimental feature to handle lazy
loading of images. Certain websites use a small placeholder image and load
the main image using Javascript, with the actual image source stored in a
\fBdata\-src\fP attribute in the \fBimg\fP tag. The experimental feature uses the
\fBdata\-src\fP attribute as the image source instead of that in the \fBsrc\fP
attribute.
