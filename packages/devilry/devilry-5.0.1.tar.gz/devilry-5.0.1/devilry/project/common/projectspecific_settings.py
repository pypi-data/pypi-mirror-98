# Hard deadlines info box message for feed.
#
# This is a info message that will appear in the top of the feed if hard
# deadlines are enabled for an assignment. You can add different translations
# of this message by adding a ISO 639-1 code mapped to a message.
#
# Example:
# DEVILRY_HARD_DEADLINE_INFO_FOR_STUDENTS = {
#   ...,
#   'en': 'This assignment uses hard deadlines...'
# }
#
# Note:
#   The '__default' is in english and is marked for translation.
#   You may override this, but it should be in a language that all the users
#   understand.
