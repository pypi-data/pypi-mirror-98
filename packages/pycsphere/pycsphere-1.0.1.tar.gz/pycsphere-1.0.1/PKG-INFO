        *Pycsou-sphere* is an extension module of the Python 3 package `Pycsou <https://github.com/matthieumeo/pycsou>`_ for solving linear inverse problems on the sphere. The extension offers implementations of spherical zonal *convolution* operators as well as the spherical harmonic and Fourier-Legendre transforms (all compatible with Pycsou's interface for linear operators). It also provides numerical routines for computing the Green kernels of common spherical pseudo-differential operators and generating spherical meshes/point sets. 
        
        This module heavily relies and follows similar conventions as the `healpy <https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package for spherical signal processing with Python. 
        
        Content
        =======
        
        The package, named `pycsphere <https://pypi.org/project/pycsphere>`_,  is organised as follows:
        
        1. The subpackage ``pycsphere.linop`` implements the following common spherical linear operators:
          
           * Convolution/pooling operators,
           * Spherical transforms and their inverses,
           * Finite-difference spherical differential operators.
        
        2. The subpackage ``pycsphere.mesh`` provides routines for generating spherical meshes. 
        3. The subpackage ``pycsphere.green`` provides numerical routines for computing the Green  kernels of common spherical pseudo-differential operators.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Pycsou-sphere requires Python 3.6 or greater. It is developed and tested on x86_64 systems running MacOS and Linux.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Before installing Pycsou-sphere, make sure that the base package `Pycsou <https://github.com/matthieumeo/pycsou>`_ is correctly installed on your machine.
        Installation instructions for Pycsou are available at `that link <https://matthieumeo.github.io/pycsou/html/general/install.html>`_.
        
        The package extra dependencies are listed in the files ``requirements.txt`` and ``requirements-conda.txt``.
        It is recommended to install those extra dependencies using `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_ or
        `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux>`_. This
        is not just a pure stylistic choice but comes with some *hidden* advantages, such as the linking to
        ``Intel MKL`` library (a highly optimized BLAS library created by Intel).
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           >> conda install --channel=conda-forge --file=requirements-conda.txt
        
        
        Quick Install
        -------------
        
        Pycsou-sphere is also available on `Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/pycsou-sphere/>`_. You can hence install it very simply via the command:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           >> pip install pycsou-sphere
        
        If you have previously activated your conda environment ``pip`` will install Pycsou in said environment.
        Otherwise it will install it in your ``base`` environment together with the various dependencies obtained from the file ``requirements.txt``.
        
        
        Developer Install
        ------------------
        
        It is also possible to install Pycsou-sphere from the source for developers:
        
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           >> git clone https://github.com/matthieumeo/pycsou-sphere
           >> cd <repository_dir>/
           >> pip install -e .
        
        The package documentation can be generated with:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           >> conda install sphinx=='2.1.*'            \
                            sphinx_rtd_theme=='0.4.*'
           >> python3 setup.py build_sphinx
        
        You can verify that the installation was successful by running the package doctests:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           >> python3 test.py
