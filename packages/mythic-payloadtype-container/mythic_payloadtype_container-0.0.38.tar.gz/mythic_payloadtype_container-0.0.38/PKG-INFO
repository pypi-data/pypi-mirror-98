Description: # Mythic Payload Type Container
        
        The `mythic_payloadtype_container` package creates an easy way to get everything set up in a new PayloadType container for a Mythic supported Payload Type. Mythic is a Command and Control (C2) framework for Red Teaming. The code is on GitHub (https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) and the Mythic project's documentation is on GitBooks (https://docs.mythic-c2.net). This code will be included in the default Mythic Payload Type containers, but is available for anybody making custom containers as well.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install the mythic scripting interface from PyPI:
        
        ```
        pip install mythic-payloadtype-container
        ```
        
        ## How to use
        
        This container reports to mythic as version 4.
        
        For the main execution of the heartbeat and service functionality, simply import and start the service:
        ```
        from mythic_payloadtype_container import mythic_service
        mythic_service.start_service_and_heartbeat()
        ```
        You can also pass `debug=True` to the `start_service_and_heartbeat()` function to get detailed debugging information.
        
        For a Payload types Profile's code to leverage the PayloadType or RPC functionality:
        ```
        from mythic_payloadtype_container import PayloadBuilder
        # optionally - from mythic_payloadtype_container.PayloadBuilder import *
        from mythic_payloadtype_container import MythicResponseRPC
        ```
