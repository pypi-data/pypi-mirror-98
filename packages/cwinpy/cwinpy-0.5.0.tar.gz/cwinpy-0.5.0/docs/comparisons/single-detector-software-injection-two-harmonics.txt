Single detector, software injection, two harmonics
==================================================

Here we compare ``lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested`` with ``cwinpy`` in the case of
simulated Gaussian noise from a single detector (H1 in this case) containing a software injected
signal with two harmonics: one at the source rotation frequency and one at twice the rotation
frequency. The parameters being estimated are :math:`C_{21}`, :math:`C_{22}`, :math:`\Phi_{21}`,
:math:`\Phi_{22}` :math:`\psi` and :math:`\cos{\iota}`, all with uniform priors.

The script for this comparison, using the `dynesty <https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
nested sampling algorithm, is shown at the bottom of the page_. It produces the following comparison
