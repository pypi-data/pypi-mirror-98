Multiple detectors, software injection (linear polarisation)
==============================================================

Here we compare ``lalapps_pulsar_parameter_estimation_nested`` with ``cwinpy`` in the case of
simulated Gaussian noise from multiple detectors (H1, L1 and V1) containing a software injected signal with close-to linear polarisation. The parameters being
estimated are :math:`h_0`, :math:`\phi_0`, :math:`\psi` and :math:`\cos{\iota}`, all with uniform priors.

The script for this comparison, using the `dynesty <https://dynesty.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ nested sampling algorithm, is shown at the bottom of the page_. It produces the following comparison data:
