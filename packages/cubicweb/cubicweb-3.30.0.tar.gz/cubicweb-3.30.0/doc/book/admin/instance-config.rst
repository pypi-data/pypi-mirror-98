Configure an instance
=====================

While creating an instance, a configuration file is generated in::

    $ (CW_INSTANCES_DIR) / <instance> / <configuration name>.conf

For example::

    /etc/cubicweb.d/myblog/all-in-one.conf

It is a simple text file in the INI format
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file). In the following description,
each option name is prefixed with its own section and followed by its
default value if necessary, e.g. "`<section>.<option>` [value]."

.. note:: At runtime, configuration options can be overriden by environments
    variables which name follows the option name with ``-`` replaced by ``_``
    and a ``CW_`` prefix. For instance ``CW_BASE_URL=https://www.example.com``
    would override the ``base-url`` configuration option.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
-----------------------------

CubicWeb's support for the CORS_ protocol is provided by the wsgicors_
middleware at the Pyramid level. For now, the provided implementation only
deals with access to a CubicWeb instance as a whole. Support for a finer
granularity may be considered in the future.

.. _wsgicors: https://pypi.org/project/wsgicors/

A few parameters can be set to configure the CORS_ capabilities of CubicWeb,
the values are passed to the `wsgicors.CORS()` middleware constructor, hence
the wsgicors documentation can be used for more details.

.. _CORS: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/
