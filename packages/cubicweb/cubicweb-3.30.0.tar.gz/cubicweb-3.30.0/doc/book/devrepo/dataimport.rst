Dataimport
==========

*CubicWeb* is designed to easily manipulate large amounts of data, and provides
utilities to make imports simple.

The main entry point is :mod:`cubicweb.dataimport.importer` which defines an
:class:`ExtEntitiesImporter` class responsible for importing data from an external source in the
form :class:`ExtEntity` objects. An :class:`ExtEntity` is a transitional representation of an
entity to be imported in the CubicWeb instance; building this representation is usually
domain-specific -- e.g. dependent of the kind of data source (RDF, CSV, etc.) -- and is thus the
responsibility of the end-user.

Along with the importer, a *store* must be selected, which is responsible for insertion of data into
the database. There exists different kind of stores_, allowing to insert data within different
levels of the *CubicWeb* API and with different speed/security tradeoffs. Those keeping all the
*CubicWeb* hooks and security will be slower but the possible errors in insertion (bad data types,
integrity error, ...) will be handled.


Example
-------

Consider the following schema snippet.

.. code-block:: python

    class Person(EntityType):
        name = String(required=True)

    class knows(RelationDefinition):
        subject = 'Person'
        object = 'Person'

along with some data in a ``people.csv`` file::

    # uri,name,knows
    http://www.example.org/alice,Alice,
    http://www.example.org/bob,Bob,http://www.example.org/alice

The following code (using a shell context) defines a function `extentities_from_csv` to read
`Person` external entities coming from a CSV file and calls the :class:`ExtEntitiesImporter` to
insert corresponding entities and relations into the CubicWeb instance.

.. code-block:: python

    from cubicweb.dataimport import ucsvreader, RQLObjectStore
    from cubicweb.dataimport.importer import ExtEntity, ExtEntitiesImporter

    def extentities_from_csv(fpath):
        """Yield Person ExtEntities read from `fpath` CSV file."""
        with open(fpath) as f:
            for uri, name, knows in ucsvreader(f, skipfirst=True, skip_empty=False):
                yield ExtEntity('Person', uri,
                                {'name': set([name]), 'knows': set([knows])})

    extenties = extentities_from_csv('people.csv')
    store = RQLObjectStore(cnx)
    importer = ExtEntitiesImporter(schema, store)
    importer.import_entities(extenties)
    commit()
    rset = cnx.execute('String N WHERE X name N, X knows Y, Y name "Alice"')
    assert rset[0][0] == u'Bob', rset

Importer API
------------

.. automodule:: cubicweb.dataimport.importer


Stores
~~~~~~

.. automodule:: cubicweb.dataimport.stores


MassiveObjectStore
------------------

This store relies on *COPY FROM* sql commands to directly push data using SQL commands
rather than using the whole *CubicWeb* API. For now, **it only works with PostgreSQL** as it requires
the *COPY FROM* command. Anything related to CubicWeb (Hooks, for instance), are bypassed. It
inserts entities directly by using one PostgreSQL ``COPY FROM`` query for a set of similarly
structured entities.

This store is the fastest, if the table is small compared to the volume of data to insert.
Indeed, it removes all indexes and constraints on the table before importing, and reapply them
at the end. This means that if the table is small compared to the amount of data you want to insert,
this store is better than the others.

NOTE: Because inlined [#]_ relations are stored in the entityâ€™s table, they must be set as any
other attributes of the entity. For instance:

.. code-block:: python

    store.prepare_insert_entity("MyEType", name="toto", favorite_email=email_address.eid)

.. [#] An inlined relation is a relation defined in the schema
       with the keyword argument ``inlined=True``. Such a relation
       is inserted in the database as an attribute of the entity
       whose subject it is.
