Url redirection using pyramid
-----------------------------

This module allow to define redirection rules used by pyramid before route selection.

Each rule has to be added with `add_rewriting_rule` method in a pyramid `includeme`
function to be used.

Example of usage :

.. code-block:: ini

    def includeme(config):
        config.add_rewriting_rule(r'<a regex>', callback_method)


The callback_method takes three arguments:

- a pyramid request ;
- the url that has to be matched by the rule ;
- a dictionnary containing all the named subgroups of the regex match.

It must return a string corresponding to the new url.
"""
import re

from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPSeeOther


def add_redirection_rule(config, rule, callback_method):
    """
    Declare a pyramid directive allowing to add a redirection rule.
    Each rewriting rule can then be added in the `includeme` at the end of the file
    by using `config.add_redirection_rule(rule, callback_method`.
    :param config: pyramid configuration, used by pyramid.
    :param rule: a regex used to match uri.
    :param callback_method: a method which return the redirected uri.
