# django-ca

**django-ca** is a small project to manage TLS certificate authorities and easily issue
certificates.  It is based on [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/) and
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/>). It can be used as an app in an existing Django project
or stand-alone with the basic project included.  Certificates can be managed through Djangos admin
interface or via `manage.py` commands - so no webserver is needed, if youâ€™re happy with the
command-line.

Documentation is available at https://django-ca.readthedocs.org/.

## ToDo

Ideas on what we could do for future releases:

1. Test CRL signing certificates.
2. Only send out one notification if multiple certificates expire for a user.
3. Add ability to automatically regenerate CRLs when a certificate is revoked.
