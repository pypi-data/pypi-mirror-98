    RPC dispatcher can have an extra endpoint named ping.
    This endpoint can be enabled thanks to a specific configuration parameter:
    [DEFAULT]
    rpc_ping_enabled=true  # default is false

    The purpose of this new endpoint is to help operators do a RPC call (a
    ping) toward a specific RPC callback (e.g. a nova-compute, or a
    neutron-agent).
    This is helping a lot for monitoring agents (for example, if agents are
    deployed in a kubernetes pod).
