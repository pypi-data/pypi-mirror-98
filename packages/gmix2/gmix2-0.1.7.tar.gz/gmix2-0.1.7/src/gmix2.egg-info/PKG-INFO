        ********
        Overview
        ********
        `gmix2 <https://bitbucket.org/reidswanson/gmix2>`_ is a reimplementation of `gmix <https://bitbucket.org/reidswanson/gmix/src/master/>`_ that provides functions for working with univariate `Gaussian Mixture distributions <https://brilliant.org/wiki/gaussian-mixture-model/>`_ similar to `dmixnorm <https://rdrr.io/cran/KScorrect/man/dmixnorm.html>`_ of the `KScorrect <https://rdrr.io/cran/KScorrect/>`_ R package.
        Unlike gmix, gmix2 does not include the code and recipes for implementing conditional density implementation using neural networks.
        This reduces the number of external dependencies and complexity of the project considerably (e.g., no need for TensorFlow).
        gmix2 is entirely written in C++ (and provides python bindings), so it is also slightly faster than gmix in most cases, and considerably faster in a a few cases [1]_.
        It also provides a few bug fixes and the plotting function has been improved.

        Dependencies
        ************
        
        * (required) `numpy <https://numpy.org/install/>`_
        * (needed for plotting) `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_
        * (needed for plotting) `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html>`_
        * (needed for plotting) `plotnine <https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`_
        * (needed for plotting) `pycairo <https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ Matplotlib may complain if this is not installed separately.
        * (needed for plotting) `PyQt5 <https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/>`_ You may need to install a rending package for interactive plots.
        
        *******
        Install
        *******
        The project is not currently on PyPI.
        The easiest way to use or install the project is to clone it or via pip using its native Git support.
        Note you may need a working C++ compiler.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/reidswanson/gmix2.git

        .. [1] Most of the functions in gmix were written using numpy so it was already relatively efficient.
