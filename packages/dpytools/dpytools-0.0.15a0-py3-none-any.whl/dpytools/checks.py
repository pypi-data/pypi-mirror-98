"""
This module holds different command checks to add as decorator for custom commands.
Use this checks on your code like this:
    ```
    @bot.command()
    @admin_or_roles('Moderator')
    async def mute(ctx, member: discord.Member):
        ...
    ```
Or inside Cogs:
    ```
    @commands.command()
    @only_this_guild(123456789...)
    async def magic(self, ctx):
        ...
    ```
