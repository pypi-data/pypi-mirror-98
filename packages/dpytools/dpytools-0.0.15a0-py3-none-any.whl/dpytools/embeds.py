    Facilitates sequential embed menus.
    Returned embeds share title, have description split at :max_length: and are added index/pages at footer to keep
    track of pages.

        title: Shared by all embeds
        description: String to be split at :max_lenght: per embed.
        max_size: Maximum amount of characters per embed. Discord's limit is 2000.
        prefix: Defaults to "" it will be appended at the start of the description of each embed.
                Useful for codeblocks (use triple back quotes).
        suffix: Same as :prefix: but at the end of the text.
        color: color to use for the embed. Accepts int (decimal or hex) or discord.Color/discord.Colour.

    Returns:
