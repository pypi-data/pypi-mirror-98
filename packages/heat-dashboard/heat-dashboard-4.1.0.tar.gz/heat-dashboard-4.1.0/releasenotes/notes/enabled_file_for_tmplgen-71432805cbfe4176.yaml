    If you need to update your queens heat-dashboard to rocky,
    you must copy the latest enabled file (_1650_project_template_generator_panel.py)
    to horizon/openstack_dashboard/enabled directory again.
    The enabled file for template generator has been changed a lot in rocky and it does not have
    compatibility with queens heat-dashboard.
    The background of this change is that SCSS and xstatic modules are started to be used
    rather than CSS and embedded JavaScript copies to follow Horizonâ€™s contribution rule.
