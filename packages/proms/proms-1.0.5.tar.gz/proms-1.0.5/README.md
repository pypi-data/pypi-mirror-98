# ProMS: protein marker selection using proteomics or multi-omics data

ProMS (*Pro*tein *M*arker *S*election) is a python package designed to tackle a novel problem of multiview
feature selection: given multiple views of same set of samples,
select important features from one view of interest (target view) by integrating
information from other views. It was initially developed to select protein
biomarkers using proteomics data with the help of additional omics views
(e.g. RNAseq).
