🐸TTS is a library for advanced Text-to-Speech generation. It's built on the latest research, was designed to achieve the best trade-off among ease-of-training, speed and quality.
🐸TTS comes with [pretrained models](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/wiki/Released-Models), tools for measuring dataset quality and already used in **20+ languages** for products and research projects.

You can also help us implement more models. Some 🐸TTS related work can be found [here](https://github.com/erogol/TTS-papers).

## Install TTS
🐸TTS is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with **python >= 3.6, < 3.9**.

If you are only interested in [synthesizing speech](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/tree/dev#example-synthesizing-speech-on-terminal-using-the-released-models) with the released 🐸TTS models, installing from PyPI is the easiest option.

```bash
pip install TTS
```

If you plan to code or train models, clone 🐸TTS and install it locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS
pip install -e .
```

We use ```espeak-ng``` to convert graphemes to phonemes. You might need to install separately.
```bash
sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
```

## Sample Model Output
Below you see Tacotron model state after 16K iterations with batch-size 32 with LJSpeech dataset.

> "Recent research at Harvard has shown meditating for as little as 8 weeks can actually increase the grey matter in the parts of the brain responsible for emotional regulation and learning."

## Datasets and Data-Loading
🐸TTS provides a generic dataloader easy to use for your custom dataset.
You just need to write a simple function to format the dataset. Check ```datasets/preprocess.py``` to see some examples.
After that, you need to set ```dataset``` fields in ```config.json```.

Some of the public datasets that we successfully applied 🐸TTS:

- [LJ Speech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)
- [Nancy](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/blizzard/2011/lessac_blizzard2011/)
- [TWEB](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/the-world-english-bible-speech-dataset)
- [M-AI-Labs](http://www.caito.de/2019/01/the-m-ailabs-speech-dataset/)
- [LibriTTS](https://openslr.org/60/)
- [Spanish](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sm_zyBo67XHkiFhcRSQ4YaHPYM0slO_e/view?usp=sharing) - thx! @carlfm01

## Example: Synthesizing Speech on Terminal Using the Released Models.

After the installation, 🐸TTS provides a CLI interface for synthesizing speech using pre-trained models. You can either use your own model or the release models under 🐸TTS.

Listing released 🐸TTS models.
```bash
tts --list_models
```

Run a tts and a vocoder model from the released model list. (Simply copy and paste the full model names from the list as arguments for the command below.)
```bash
tts --text "Text for TTS" \
    --model_name "<type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>" \
    --vocoder_name "<type>/<language>/<dataset>/<model_name>" \
    --out_path folder/to/save/output/
```

Run your own TTS model (Using Griffin-Lim Vocoder)
```bash
tts --text "Text for TTS" \
    --model_path path/to/model.pth.tar \
    --config_path path/to/config.json \
    --out_path output/path/speech.wav
```

Run your own TTS and Vocoder models
```bash
tts --text "Text for TTS" \
    --model_path path/to/config.json \
    --config_path path/to/model.pth.tar \
    --out_path output/path/speech.wav \
    --vocoder_path path/to/vocoder.pth.tar \
    --vocoder_config_path path/to/vocoder_config.json
```

**Note:** You can use ```./TTS/bin/synthesize.py``` if you prefer running ```tts``` from the TTS project folder.

## Example: Training and Fine-tuning LJ-Speech Dataset
Here you can find a [CoLab](https://gist.github.com/erogol/97516ad65b44dbddb8cd694953187c5b) notebook for a hands-on example, training LJSpeech. Or you can manually follow the guideline below.

To start with, split ```metadata.csv``` into train and validation subsets respectively ```metadata_train.csv``` and ```metadata_val.csv```. Note that for text-to-speech, validation performance might be misleading since the loss value does not directly measure the voice quality to the human ear and it also does not measure the attention module performance. Therefore, running the model with new sentences and listening to the results is the best way to go.

```
shuf metadata.csv > metadata_shuf.csv
head -n 12000 metadata_shuf.csv > metadata_train.csv
tail -n 1100 metadata_shuf.csv > metadata_val.csv
```

To train a new model, you need to define your own ```config.json``` to define model details, trainin configuration and more (check the examples). Then call the corressponding train script.

For instance, in order to train a tacotron or tacotron2 model on LJSpeech dataset, follow these steps.

```bash
python TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json
```

To fine-tune a model, use ```--restore_path```.

```bash
python TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json --restore_path /path/to/your/model.pth.tar
```

To continue an old training run, use ```--continue_path```.

```bash
python TTS/bin/train_tacotron.py --continue_path /path/to/your/run_folder/
```

For multi-GPU training, call ```distribute.py```. It runs any provided train script in multi-GPU setting.

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,4" python TTS/bin/distribute.py --script train_tacotron.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json
```

Each run creates a new output folder accomodating used ```config.json```, model checkpoints and tensorboard logs.

In case of any error or intercepted execution, if there is no checkpoint yet under the output folder, the whole folder is going to be removed.

You can also enjoy Tensorboard,  if you point Tensorboard argument```--logdir``` to the experiment folder.
