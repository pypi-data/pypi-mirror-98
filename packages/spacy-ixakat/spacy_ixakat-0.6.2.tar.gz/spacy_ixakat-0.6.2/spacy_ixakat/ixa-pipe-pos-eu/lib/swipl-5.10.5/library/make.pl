/** <module>  Reload modified source files

This module provides the SWI-Prolog   `make'  facility that synchronises
Prolog internal database after loaded files have been edited.

@bug	Dependency tracking is incomplete.  Notably, there is no
	dependency tracking if compilation of one module depends
	on goal_expansion/2 or term_expansion/2 rules provided by
	another.
