=========

Mission statement
-----------------
This project implements a JSON control-plane based on the [envoy](https://envoyproxy.io) [data-plane-api](https://github.com/envoyproxy/data-plane-api)

The purpose of `sovereign` is to supply downstream envoy proxies with 
configuration in near-realtime by responding to discovery requests.

Mechanism of Operation
----------------------
tl;dr version:
```
* Polls HTTP/File/Other for data
* (optional) Applies transforms to the data
* Uses the data to generate Envoy configuration from templates
```

In a nutshell, Sovereign 
gathers contextual data (*"sources"* and *"template context"*), 
optionally applies transforms to that data (using *"modifiers"*) and finally 
uses the data to generate envoy configuration from either python code, or jinja2 templates.

This is performed in a semi-stateless way, where the only state is data cached in memory.

Template context is intended to be statically configured, whereas *Sources* 
are meant to be dynamic - for example, fetching from an API, an S3 bucket, 
or a file that receives updates.

*Modifiers* can mutate the data retrieved from sources, just in case the data 
is in a less than favorable structure.

Both modifiers and sources are pluggable, i.e. it's easy to write your own and 
plug them into Sovereign for your use-case.

Currently, Sovereign supports only providing configuration to Envoy as JSON. 
That is to say, gRPC is not supported yet. Contributions in this area are highly
appreciated!

The JSON configuration can be viewed in real-time with Sovereign's read-only web interface.

Requirements
------------
* Python 3.8+

Installation
------------
```
pip install sovereign
```

Local development
=================

Requirements
------------
* Docker
* Docker-compose

Installing dependencies for dev
-------------------------------
I recommend creating a virtualenv before doing any dev work

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Running locally
---------------
Running the test env

```
make run
```
    
Running the test env daemonized

```
make run-daemon
```

Pylint

```
make lint
```

Unit tests

```
make unit
```

Acceptance tests

```
make run-daemon acceptance
```
