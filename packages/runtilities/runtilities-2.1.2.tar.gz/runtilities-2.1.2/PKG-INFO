Description: runtilities - running utilities
        ===================================
        
        This is a package with a few hopefully useful running utilities.
        
        package name is "running". Yes I know that's confusing.
        
        Install
        
            pip install runtilities
            
        Usage, e.g.
        
            from running.runsignup import RunSignUp
        
        A lot of this may be obsolete and hasn't been tested for a while, 
        so your mileage may vary. Sorry about that.
