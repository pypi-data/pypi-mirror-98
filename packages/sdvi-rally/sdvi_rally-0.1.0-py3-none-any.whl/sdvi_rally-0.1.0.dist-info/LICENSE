SDVI Corporation (“SDVI”) licenses the software, modules, scripts and/or other code accompanied
by this license (the “Code”) to SDVI’s customer receiving the Code (“you”) subject to the following
terms and conditions.

The Code is proprietary to SDVI. It relates to SDVI’s media supply-chain management platform known
as SDVI Rally (the “Rally Platform”). Your rights under this license apply only if and while you
have a current, signed services agreement or license agreement in place with SDVI authorizing you
to use the Rally Platform (the “Signed Agreement”). This license is intended to supplement the
Signed Agreement, but the terms of the Signed Agreement will supersede the terms of this license
to the extent of any conflict.

SDVI grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to do the following, solely in connection with
your authorized use of the Rally Platform under the Signed Agreement: (a) modify and create
derivative works of any source code or other modifiable materials included in the Code, (b)
compile (where applicable) and install and use the Code, with or without your permitted
modifications, and (c) reproduce the Code as necessary to perform the activities above.

You may not distribute, publish, disclose, or sublicense the Code, in any form, with or without
your modifications, except you may provide copies to your employees, contractors, and other
personnel as needed for them to perform the activities authorized above on your behalf. Those
personnel receive no other rights under this license, and any use of or other dealings in the
Code that are outside the scope of the above license or that violate any terms or conditions
set forth in this license or the Signed Agreement are unauthorized. Subject to the limited
license granted to you above, SDVI reserves all rights in the Code, including all associated
copyrights and other intellectual property rights.

You must ensure that all copies of the Code, whether complete or partial, modified or unmodified:
(a) retain any copyright and other notices as originally included in or with such Code, and
(b) are accompanied by a complete copy of this license, including the disclaimers below.

UNLESS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED IN THE SIGNED AGREEMENT: (a) THE CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS",
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT, AND (b) IN NO EVENT
SHALL SDVI OR ANY OTHER AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE CODE OR THE USE OF OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE CODE.
