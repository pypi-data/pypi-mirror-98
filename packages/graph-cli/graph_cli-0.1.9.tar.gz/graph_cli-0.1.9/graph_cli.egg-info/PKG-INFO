Description: # graph-cli
        
        A CLI utility to create graphs from CSV files.
        
        `graph-cli` is designed to be highly configurable for easy and detailed
        graph generation. It has many flags to acquire this detail and uses
        reasonable defaults to avoid bothering the user. It also leverages
        chaining, so you can create complex graphs from multiple CSV files.
