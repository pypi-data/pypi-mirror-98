/**

 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesComponent Component
 *
 * Component of a data set.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A Component is stored in a components collection and contains the meta data
 * for a specific component in a data set. Each component relates to a set of
 * properties which a profile relating to the component will hold the values
 * for.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * As there are generally only a small number of components in a data set, they
 * can be accessed via a list structure instead of fetching from the base
 * collection. This ensures that a reference the collection item is always held
 * open and can be used at any time.
