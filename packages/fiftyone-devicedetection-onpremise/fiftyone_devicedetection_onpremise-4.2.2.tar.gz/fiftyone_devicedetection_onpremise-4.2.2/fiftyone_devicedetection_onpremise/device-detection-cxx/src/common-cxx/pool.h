 *
 * Pool of handles to allow safe access to multiple threads.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A Pool structure defines a pool of handles to a resource, and allows a safe
 * way to access them in a multi-threaded environment.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * The #fiftyoneDegreesPoolInit method is used to initialise a pointer to
 * a #fiftyoneDegreesPool. A concurrency value is provided to indicate the
 * maximum number of threads that will be in operation. If this value is lower
 * than the actual number of threads the stack can be exhausted and a null
 * pointer is returned instead of a valid item. The concurrency value must
 * always be the same or greater than the number of threads. When compiled
 * in single threaded operation a pool is not strictly required and the
 * implementation maintains a simple stack for consistency of interface and to
 * minimise divergent code.
 *
 * ## Get & Release
 *
 * Handles are retrieved from the pool via the #fiftyoneDegreesPoolItemGet
 * method. The handle **MUST** be returned with the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesPoolItemRelease method when it is finished with. The
 * handle will always be open and ready for read only operation. If too many
 * threads are accessing the pool simultaneously, meaning a handle cannot be
 * secured, then a NULL pointer is returned.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * The items are closed when the pool is released via the
 *  #fiftyoneDegreesPoolFree method. Any memory allocated by the implementation
 * for the stack is freed.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE;
 * void *state;
 * fiftyoneDegreesPoolResourceCreate resourceCreate;
 * fiftyoneDegreesPoolResourceFree resourceFree;
 * fiftyoneDegreesPool pool;
 *
 * // Initialise a pool of resources and check that it was successful
 * if (fiftyoneDegreesPoolInit(
 *     &pool,
 *     1,
 *     state,
 *     resourceCreate,
 *     resourceFree,
 *     exception) != NULL) {
 *
 *     // Get a resource from the pool
 *     fiftyoneDegreesPoolItem *item = fiftyoneDegreesPoolItemGet(
 *         &pool,
 *         exception);
 *
 *     // Check that there was a resource available
 *     if (item != NULL) {
 *
 *         // Do something with the resource without being interrupted by other
 *         // threads
 *         // ...
 *
 *         // Release the resource back to the pool
 *         fiftyoneDegreesPoolItemRelease(item);
 *     }
 *
 *     // Free the pool of resources
 *     fiftyoneDegreesPoolFree(&pool);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Design
 *
 * To improve performance in multi-threaded operation a non locking stack is 
 * used where a Compare and Swap (CAS) atomic operation is used to pop and push 
 * handles on and off the stack. The design was adapted from the following 
 * article (http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/09/02/) which explains some of the 
 * challenges involved including the ABA problem 
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem). It is for this reason the head 
 * structure is implemented as a union between the values and the exchange
 * integer. Pointers are not used as the address space for the stack is 
 * continuous and always very small compared to the total addressable memory 
 * space.
