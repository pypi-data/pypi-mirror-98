/**
 * @ingroup FiftyOneDegreesCommon
 * @defgroup FiftyOneDegreesDataSet Data Set
 *
 * A data file initialised in a structure.
 *
 * ## Terms
 *
 * **Get** : returns an immutable data set that must be released when the
 * caller is finished with it.

 * **Release** : releases a reference on the data set returned from the Get
 * operation.

 * **Reload** : reloads an existing data set while maintaining any current
 * references to the existing data set.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * A DataSet is a data file initialised in a structure that can be used to
 * process data. Collections from the file may be stored in memory or streamed
 * from the file when needed.
 *
 * A DataSet is used to process data, in most cases this is in the form of
 * evidence. Values for the Properties which the data set is capable of
 * returning can then be retrieved from the result of processing.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * A DataSet is created by allocating the structure and initialising from one
 * of the following:
 *
 * **File** : a data file is either read into memory or handle maintained for
 * streaming by the data set.
 *
 * **Memory** : a data file read into continuous memory is used by the data set.
 *
 * ## Operation
 *
 * A DataSet is a resource to be maintained by a Resource Manager. So any
 * thread wanting to use it must get a reference from the manager
 * (see resource.h).
 *
 * The data set implementation extending will contain methods to process data.
 * Usually these will return a Results instance (or an extending structure),
 * see results.h for more details.
 *
 * ## Reloading
 *
 * A DataSet can be reloaded without interrupting operation by using the 
 * defined Reload methods. These take either a new data file or a new memory
 * pointer, initialise a new data set, and replace the existing one in a
 * thread-safe manor.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * A DataSet is a managed resource, so it should not be freed directly. Instead
 * the manager should be freed, so that the data set is safely freed without
 * impacting other threads.
