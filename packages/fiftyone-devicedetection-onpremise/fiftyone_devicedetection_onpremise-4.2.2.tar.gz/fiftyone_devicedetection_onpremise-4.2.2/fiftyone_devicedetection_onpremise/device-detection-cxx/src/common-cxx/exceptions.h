/**

 *
 * Allow the bubbling up or errors in C.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * An exception structure is used to allow the bubbling up of errors, as C
 * does not support exceptions in that way. This means that instead of an error
 * causing a segmentation fault elsewhere, the exception is set and passed all
 * the way up to be checked.
 *
 * ## Creating
 * 
 * Exceptions are created by the caller using the
 * #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE macro which creates an exception pointer
 * named "exception". This is then passed into any method which can potentially
 * throw an exception.
 *
 * ## Checking
 *
 * An exception can be checked using the #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_OKAY macro
 * which will return true if there is no exception, or false if an exception
 * has occurred.
 *
 * ## Throwing
 *
 * In the event that an exception has occurred in a method, it can be checked
 * and thrown using the #FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_THROW macro. If the
 * exception is okay, then nothing will be thrown by this macro, so it is safe
 * to call as a "catch and throw" method. This will behave differently
 * depending on whether it is used in the context of C or C++.
 *
 * **C** : C does not support exceptions, so if there is an exception, the
 * exception message will be printed to standard output, then the process will
 * exit.
 *
 * **C++** : As C++ supports exceptions, an fatal exception with the message
 * will be thrown. This can then be caught or handled in whichever way the
 * caller sees fit.
 *
 * ## Messages
 *
 * The error message returned by an exception consists of the error message
 * itself, the name of the source file which caused the error, the name of the
 * function which caused the error and the line in the source file at which the
 * error occurred.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * // Create an exception
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE;
 * // Set the exception a failure status
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_SET(FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STATUS_NULL_POINTER);
 * // Check the exception
 * if  (FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_FAILED) {
 *     // Throw the exception
 *     FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_THROW;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Disabling
 *
 * To improve performance, exception handling can be disabled completely by
 * compiling with FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTIONS_DISABLED. This changes all the
 * macro calls to do nothing, meaning that no checks occur, and no exceptions
 * are thrown.
