 *
 * A more manageable way to store arrays.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Lists are a way of storing an array of elements in an easy to manage way.
 * This means that the capacity, and the number of elements are both known
 * quantities to any method handling the list, in contrast to a pure array
 * where neither are known.
 * Lists hold collection items, so when they are finished with, they must be
 * freed correctly using the #fiftyoneDegreesListFree method.
 * Cleanup is also handled so as to be simpler to use than an array. By freeing
 * the list, all elements are released from their collection and the memory
 * for the list is freed.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * Lists are created by allocating memory to the list structure, then calling
 * the init method #fiftyoneDegreesListInit to allocate memory for list items
 * and initialise the count and capacity.
 *
 * ## Add
 *
 * Collection items are added to a list using the #fiftyoneDegreesListAdd
 * method. This then holds the reference to the collection item until the list
 * is freed.
 *
 * ## Get
 *
 * Items can be fetched from the list by accessing the collection item
 * directly:
 * ```
 * list->items[index]
 * ```
 * then casting the pointer it contains to the correct type. Or for strings
 * the #fiftyoneDegreesListGetAsString method can be used to access and cast
 * in one call.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * Lists must be freed using the #fiftyoneDegreesListFree method. This releases
 * all collection items stored within, and frees the memory for the internal
 * array which stores their pointers.
 *
 * ## Reuse
 *
 * Lists can be reused by releasing all the collection items with the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesListRelease method, clearing the list ready for a new list
 * of items to be added.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * fiftyoneDegreesList list;
 * fiftyoneDegreesCollectionItem *item;
 *
 * // Initialise the list with the capacity for 1 entry
 * fiftyoneDegreesListInit(&list, 1);
 *
 * // Add an item from a collection to the list
 * fiftyoneDegreesListAdd(&list, item);
 *
 * // Get the first item in the list as a string
 * fiftyoneDegreesString *string = fiftyoneDegreesListGetAsString(&list, 0);
 *
 * // Do Something with the string
 * // ...
 *
 * // Free the list, releasing the items it contains back to their respective
 * // collections
 * fiftyoneDegreesListFree(&list);
 * ```
