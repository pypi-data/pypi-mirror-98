 *
 * File handle pool and simple file operations e.g. copy and delete.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Implements a pool of file handles for use within multi-threaded environments
 * where the overhead of opening and closing a file handle for each thread
 * would be too great. Primarily used to load collection items from file with 
 * file based collections or where a cache is used.
 *
 * ## Creation
 *
 * The #fiftyoneDegreesFilePoolInit method is used to initialise a pointer to
 * a #fiftyoneDegreesFilePool. A concurrency value is provided to indicate the
 * maximum number of threads that will be in operation. If this value is lower
 * than the actual number of threads the stack can be exhausted and a null
 * pointer is returned instead of a valid file handle. The concurrency value
 * must always be the same or greater than the number of threads. When compiled
 * in single threaded operation a pool is not strictly required and the
 * implementation maintains a simple stack for consistency of interface and to
 * minimise divergent code.
 *
 * ## Get & Release
 *
 * Handles are retrieved from the pool via the #fiftyoneDegreesFileHandleGet 
 * method. The handle **MUST** be returned with the 
 * #fiftyoneDegreesFileHandleRelease method when it is finished with. The
 * handle will always be open and ready for read only operation. The position
 * of the handle within the source file cannot be assumed. If too many threads
 * are accessing the pool simultaneously, meaning a handle cannot be secured,
 * then a NULL pointer is returned.
 *
 * ## Free
 *
 * The handles are closed when the reader is released via the
 * #fiftyoneDegreesFilePoolRelease method. Any memory allocated by the 
 * implementation for the stack is freed.
 *
 * ## File Operations
 *
 * Common file operations can also be carried out using the methods defined
 * here. The supported operations are:
 *
 * **copy** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileCopy
 *
 * **create directory** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileCreateDirectory
 *
 * **create temp file** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileCreateTempFile
 *
 * **delete** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileDelete
 *
 * **get existing temp file** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileGetExistingTempFile
 *
 * **get file name** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileGetFileName
 *
 * **get path** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileGetPath
 *
 * **get size** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileGetSize
 *
 * **open** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileOpen
 *
 * **read to byte array** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileReadToByteArray
 *
 * **write** : #fiftyoneDegreesFileWrite
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```
 * FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_CREATE;
 * fiftyoneDegreesFilePool pool;
 * const char *fileName;
 *
 * // Initialise a file pool
 * fiftyoneDegreesStatus status = fiftyoneDegreesFilePoolInit(
 *     &filePool,
 *     fileName,
 *     1,
 *     exception);
 *
 * // Check that the pool was initialised successfully
 * if (status == FIFTYONE_DEGREES_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
 *
 *     // Get a file handle from the pool
 *     fiftyoneDegreesFileHandle *handle = fiftyoneDegreesFileHandleGet(
 *         &pool,
 *         exception);
 *
 *     // Check that the handle was returned successfully
 *     if (FIFTYONE_DEGREES_EXCEPTION_OKAY) {
 *
 *         // Do something with the file pointer in handle->file
 *         // ...
 *
 *         // Release the file handle back to the pool
 *         fiftyoneDegreesFileHandleRelease(handle);
 *     }
 *
 *     // Release the file pool
 *     fiftyoneDegreesFilePoolRelease(&pool);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Design
 *
 * To improve performance in multi-threaded operation a non locking stack is 
 * used where a Compare and Swap (CAS) atomic operation is used to pop and push 
 * handles on and off the stack. The design was adapted from the following 
 * article (http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/09/02/) which explains some of the 
 * challenges involved including the ABA problem 
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem). It is for this reason the head 
 * structure is implemented as a union between the values and the exchange
 * integer. Pointers are not used as the address space for the stack is 
 * continuous and always very small compared to the total addressable memory 
 * space.
