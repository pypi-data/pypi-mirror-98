 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Array structures contain an array of fixed size items, along with the
 * number of items and the capacity of the array. This makes passing it around
 * much simpler as the extra information can be passed with it.
 *
 * The macros also allow additional members to the added to the structure.
