/**

 *
 * Implementation of the classic red black binary tree.
 *
 * ## Introduction
 *
 * Implementation of a classic red black binary tree adapted to support the
 * result set structure used in the LRU cache. Several important considerations
 * should be noted with this implementation.
 *
 * 1. The maximum number of entries in the tree is known when the tree is
 *    created. All memory allocation is performed at initialisation.
 * 2. Once the tree is full it will remain full and never shrinks. The memory
 *    used is freed when the cache is freed.
 * 3. A node in the tree also contains other data such as the linked list
 *    pointers used to identify the first and last entry in the cache, and
 *    the cache data itself. See structure Node.
 * 4. The cache structure Cache contains special fields "empty"
 *    and "root". "Empty" is used in place of NULL to indicate that the left,
 *    right or parent pointer of the node has no data. The use of "empty" makes
 *    the algorithm more efficient as the data structure used to indicate no
 *    data is the same as a valid data structure and therefore does not require
 *    custom logic. The "root" fields left pointer is used as the start of the
 *    tree. Similarly the parent element being a valid data structure
 *    simplifies the algorithm.
 *
 * Developers modifying this section of code should be familiar with the red
 * black tree design template. Code comments assume an understanding of the
 * principles involved.
 *
