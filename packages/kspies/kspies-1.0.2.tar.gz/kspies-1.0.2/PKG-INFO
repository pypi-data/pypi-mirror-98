        This package simplifies evaluating Kohn-Sham inversion potentials and densities for use in quantum chemistry.
        In addition to documentation of the scientific code, this site includes information on installation, setup, use, and examples of use to equip quantum chemists and physicists with this useful toolkit. 
        Please let us know if you have further questions, suggestions, or ideas.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        * Prerequisites
            - Python 3.6 or higher
            - Numpy 1.8.0 or higher
            - Scipy 1.4.1 or higher
            - PySCF 1.6.6 or higher
            - LAPACK(for Fortran)
        
        * Code Ocean
          Our code is uploaded in the Code Ocean for verification without dependencies (Link:TODO)
        
        * Installation
          Using pip:
        
                pip install kspies
        
          For systems not supported by the manylinux wheel, user can run using the python implimentation, or compile the fortran code `kspies/kspies_fort.f90` for their system.
          Example compile commands are detailed in `kspies/compile.sh`
