        This package simplifies evaluating Kohn-Sham inversion potentials and densities for use in the quantum chemistry.
        In addition to documentation of the scientific code, this site includes information on installation, setup, use, and examples of use to equip quantum chemists and physicists with this useful toolkit. 
        Please let us know if you have further questions, suggestions, or ideas.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        * Prerequisites
            - Python 3.6 or higher
            - Numpy 1.8.0 or higher
            - Scipy 1.4.1 or higher
            - PySCF 1.6.6 or higher
            - opt\_einsum 3.2.0 or higher
            - LAPACK(for Fortran)
        
        * Installation
          Using pip:
        
                pip install kspies
        
          Note this does not downloads compiled Fortran binary directly.
          User can compile `kspies/kspies_fort.f90` to utilize much faster Fortran subroutine for `wy` and `util`.
          Example compile command is introduced in `kspies/compile.sh`
