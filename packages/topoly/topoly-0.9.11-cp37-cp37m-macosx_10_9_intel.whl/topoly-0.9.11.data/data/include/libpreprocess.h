//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// ALL FUNCTIONS CLOSING CHAIN/CHAINS
// add to <chain> some atoms (1,2 or many along the big sphere - with R=10*(diameter of structure) - surrounding structure) to close it.
// They choose those additional atoms in different ways:

int CloseChain_OUT( vector<ChainAtom> & chain, double r = R_close1chain_DEF );
// MANY additional atoms, chosen in a DETERMINICTIC way, method "out of the center of mass":
// adds long arms to the ends of <chain> in the direction going out from the center of mass of structure through those ends,
// then connects those arms along the big sphere;

int CloseChain_2points( vector<ChainAtom> & chain, double r = R_close1chain_DEF );
// MANY additional atoms, chosen in a RANDOM way:
// connects each end with different, randomly chosen point on the big sphere and those points are connected along the big sphere;

int CloseChain_1point( vector<ChainAtom> & chain, double r = R_close1chain_DEF );
// 1 additional atom, chosen in a RANDOM way:
// connects both ends with the same, randomly chosen point on the big sphere;

int CloseChain_1direction( vector<ChainAtom> & chain );
// 2 additional atoms, chosen in a RANDOM way:
// chooses randomly one point on the big sphere and this point determines the direction (vector) which we add long arms to both ends in,
// then those arms are connected with one segment;

int CloseChain_1direction_NoRandom( vector<ChainAtom> & chain, int nr = 0);
// 2 additional atoms, chosen in a DETERMINISTIC way:
// similar to previous CloseChain_1direction() but the point on the big sphere is chosen from above (it is fuleren[nr]);

// ----------
// ANALOGOUS FUNCTIONS FOR LINKS
// The only difference between using them and using previous functions for each chain (component) separately is R of the big sphere -
// here we are sure that all chains are closed outside of the structure (including other chains);

int CloseChains_OUT( vector< vector<ChainAtom> > & vComp, double r = R_closeChains_DEF );
// CloseChain_OUT_Link

int CloseChains_2points( vector< vector<ChainAtom> > & vComp, double r = R_closeChains_DEF );
// CloseChain_F_Link_2points

int CloseChains_1point( vector< vector<ChainAtom> > & vComp, double r = R_closeChains_DEF );
// CloseChain_F_Link_1point

int CloseChains_1direction( vector< vector<ChainAtom> > & vComp );
// CloseChain_F_Link_1direction

// -------------------------------------------------------

int ChainReduce(vector<ChainAtom> & chain, bool closed = true);
// reduces <chain> using KMT algorithm - for closed chains it doesn't change the topology;
// <closed> causes that we threat <chain> as closed, with connected ends;
// returns the length of <chain> after reduction;
// (while KMT - if "bond is touching the triangle exactly on the border", then we treat it as it would be an intersection - so we don't delete the vertex)

int ChainsReduce(vector< vector<ChainAtom> > & vComp, bool closed = true);
// similar to ChainReduce(), but reduces chains from all components (<vComp>) simultaneously, we need it for links;
// returns sum of lengths of all components after reduction;

// -------------------------------------------------------

vector<Edge> ProjectChain(const vector<ChainAtom> & chain, int dir = 0, bool closed = true);
// projects <chain> into the plane according to chosen direction <dir> (i.e. the direction is defined by the point in array <fuleren>, fuleren[dir]);
// returns vector of Edges, <closed> causes that we add to this vector Edge connecting two ends of <chain>;
