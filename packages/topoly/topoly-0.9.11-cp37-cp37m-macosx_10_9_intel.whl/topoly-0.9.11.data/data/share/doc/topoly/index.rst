Welcome to Topoly
==================================
Topoly is a **Python** package that collects programs useful for 
**polymer topology** analysis. We wanted to make it simple in use, but powerful
at the same time. 

We provide twofold tutorial for our package. `In the first part 
<https://topoly.cent.uw.edu.pl/tutorial.html>`_ all functions are briefly 
presented with explanation of idea how do they work. The second part is 
`topoly_tutorial package <https://github.com/ilbsm/topoly_tutorial/>`_ with 
examples of Topoly package usage.


What you can do with Topoly?
----------------------------------

* Find knots, links, lassos, theta-curves, handcuffs and their type.
* Calculate knot/link invariants:

  * Polynomials: Alexander, Jones, Conway, HOMFLY, Yamada, Kauffman, BLM/Ho,
  * Brackets: Kauffman, APS,
  * Other: writhe, Gaussian linking number.

* Find minimal surface of a loop.
* Simplify polymer structure preserving its topology.
* Generate random polygon structures: walks, loops, lassos, handcuffs.
* Generate knot map (like in KnotProt).
* Calculate sum (U) and product (#) of knots.
* Visualize structures.
