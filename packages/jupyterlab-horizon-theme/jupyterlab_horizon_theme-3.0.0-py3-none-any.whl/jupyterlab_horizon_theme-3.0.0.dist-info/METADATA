VSCode Horizon Theme port for JupyterLab

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29782314/69231444-6d1be500-0bcc-11ea-9bf6-635e425d69df.png" alt="drawing" width="900"/>


## Installation

```bash
jupyter labextension install @mohirio/jupyterlab-horizon-theme
```

This theme works best with Chromium based browsers.

To get the same looks as the screenshot, create a shortcut with any browser and tick "Open As Window", you'll have an "Almost" standalone JupyterLab app.

## Issues
Please report any issues you might have and I'll try to get it fixed as soon as possible.
