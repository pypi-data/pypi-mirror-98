features:
  - Add a new config option can_migrate_between_any_hosts in the
    compute-feature-enabled section, which can be set to False for environment
    with non homogeneous compute nodes, so that it can select a destination
    host for migrating automatically, otherwise the testcase may fail
    unexpectedly. e.g., if source host is with CPU "E5-2699 v4" and the
    selected target host is with CPU "E5-2670 v3", the live-migration will
    fail because of the downgrade issue.
