features:
  - |
    Keystone provides the new scoped token called ``system`` which
    can be used to query the system scoped API operation. Projects
    are moving towards the policy with new scope types, Keystone, Nova
    already provide the new policy for RBAC checks. Tempest has added
    the support to query the system scoped token from keystone to test
    the new policy.
    As next step, we will be moving all the Tempest tests on the project's
    new policy.
