deprecations:
  - |
    In this release the following tempest arguments are deprecated and
    replaced by new ones which are functionally equivalent:

     * --black-regex is replaced by --exclude-regex
     * --blacklist-file is replaced by --exclude-list
     * --whitelist-file is replaced by --include-list

    For now Tempest supports both (new and old ones) in order to make the
    transition for all consumers smoother. However, that's just a temporary
    case and the old options will be removed soon.
