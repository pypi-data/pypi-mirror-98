    Compute the probability that the sum over the dimkeys is between 0 and cdfpt.
    In general, it could require integrating over a large space, since -1e10 + 1e10 = 0.
    So we REQUIRE distrs than do not have any negative support. 
    input:
        distr: a multivariate distribution object
        dimkeys: the keys in distr over which the sum is considered
        cdfpt: the value for which the cdf is to be calculated

        is straight monte carlo even though in the application of interest
        we know that the RVs are strongly correlated.
    ASSUME that all dimensions have a domain that extends as far as it needs to, but 
           HAS NO NEGATIVE PART. 
        (Oct 2017 TDB: add upper and lower bounds to each dimension. non-trivial)
