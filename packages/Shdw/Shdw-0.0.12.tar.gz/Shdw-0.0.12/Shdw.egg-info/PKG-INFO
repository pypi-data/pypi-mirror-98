Description: # The Shdw Package
        The Shdw Package was originally made for any useful/not useful functions. There may be a random function you need, just look to the Shdw package!
        ## Packages used:
        + replit
        + pygame
        + pyfiglet
        ## Other info
        If you are going to import the package, I would suggest importing it at the very start of your program before you do anything. This is becuase
        A. I am importing pygame, and initializing it
        B. I am `pip install`ing pyfiglet
        (I already have it clearing up the console for you)
        ## Pygame Usage
        Use `init_pygame(width, height, title)` to create and return your window. Variables are below.
        + GUI -> pygame
        + GUI_events -> pygame.event
        + GUI_out -> pygame.draw
        + GUI_clock -> pygame.time
        ## Replit Usage
