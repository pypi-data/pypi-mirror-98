# This file configures the behavior of the TasksMaterialsBuilder

# the types of tasks that are considered for building the materials collection
# Any tasks without a task_label in the supported_task_labels will not be used
# to create a new material!
supported_task_labels:
  - "structure optimization"
  - "static"
  - "nscf uniform"
  - "nscf line"
  - "hse gap"
  - "static dielectric"

# Each entry in property settings includes:
# (i) a list of materials properties that are affected
# (ii) where those properties are currently located in the tasks (tasks_key) and should be entered
#    into the materials (materials_key) collections
# (iii) quality scores that define which kinds of task labels give better accuracy for those
#    properties. If two different tasks on the same material give different property values, these
#    scores determine which task to trust more.
