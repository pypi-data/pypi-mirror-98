Description: # experiments.py
        
        Experiments allow us to determine the impact of changes we make. This library
        helps you run and track them in Baseplate.py services.
        
        Documentation: https://reddit-experiments.readthedocs.io/
        
        ## Usage
        
        Install the library:
        
        ```console
        $ pip install reddit-experiments
        ```
        
        Add the client to your application's Baseplate context:
        
        ```python
        baseplate.configure_context(
          {
             ...
             "experiments": ExperimentsClient(event_logger),
             ...
          }
        )
        ```
        
        and use it in request:
        
        ```python
        def my_method(request):
           if request.experiments.variant("foo") == "bar":
               pass
        ```
        
        See [the documentation] for more information.

        ## Development
        
        A Dockerfile is provided to get a development environment running. To use it,
        build the base Docker image:
        
        ```console
        $ docker build -t experiments .
        ```
        
        And then fire up the environment and use the provided Makefile targets to do
        common tasks:
        
        ```console
        $ docker run -it -v $PWD:/src -w /src experiments
        $ make fmt
        ```
        
        The following make targets are provided:
        
        * `fmt`: Apply automatic formatting to the source code.
        * `lint`: Run linters on the code.
        * `test`: Run the test suite.
        * `docs`: Build the docs. Output can be found in `build/html/`.
        
        Note: some tests are skipped by default locally because they are quite slow.
        Enable these by setting CI=true in the environment: `CI=true make test`.
