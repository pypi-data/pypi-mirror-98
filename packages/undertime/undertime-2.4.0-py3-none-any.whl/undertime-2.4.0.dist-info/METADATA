Undertime - pick a meeting time
===============================

This program allows you to quickly pick a meeting time across multiple
timezones for conference calls or other coordinated events. It shows
all times of a given day for all the timezones selected, in a table
that aligns the time so a line shows simultaneous times across all
timezones. This takes into account daylight savings and other
peculiarities (provided that the local timezone database is up to
date) so you can also schedule meetings in the future as well.

Usage
=====

Timezones should be passed on the commandline and are matched against
the `list of known timezones`_, as defined by the `pytz`_
package. Exact matches are attempted at first, but if that fails,
substring matches are allowed, which makes it possible to do this::

  undertime.py New_York Los_Angeles

The complete list of timezones is also shown when the
``--list-zones`` commandline option is provided.

Colors are used to highlight the "work hours" where possible meeting
times could overlap. You can change those work hours with the
``--start`` and ``--end`` flags. The number of zones matching those
hours is listed in the last column.

Because daylight savings may actually change time, you can also use
the ``--date`` time to pick an arbitrary time for the meeting, using
natural language (as parsed by the `dateparser`_ or `parsedatetime`_
modules, if available). The current time is also shown, in bold. A
configuration file can be used to set defaults.

The output format is controled by the `tabulate`_ program. See the
`tabulate documentation <tabulate>`_ for more information about the
possible outputs.

Summary usage is available with the ``--help`` flag and full help in
the manpage. Instructions for how to contribute to the project are in
``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` and there is a ``CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst``.

Known issues and limitations
============================

Undertime was written using Python 3.5 and 3.7 and there is no
guarantee it will work in older (or newer) Python releases.

Timezones -- and time in general -- are hard problems: the math is
hard, and the zones constantly. What may be applicable to your
location at the current time may not be reflected by your operating
system or the chain of software used by this program to determine
time. `According to this video <timezone-video>`_ from `Tom Scott
<tomscott>`_, "*you really should never, ever deal with timezones if
you can help it*". This sounds a lot like what this program does, but
do note that:

    "What you learn, after dealing with timezones, is that what you
    do, is you put away your code, you don't try and write anything to
    deal with this. You look at the people who have been there before
    you. You look at the first people, the people who've done this
    before, the people who've built the spaghetti code, and you go to
    them, and you thank them very much for making it open source, and
    you give them credit, and you take what they've made, you put it
    in your program. and you never ever look at it again. because that
    way lies madness."

    -- Tom Scott

That is what this program does. It reuses the `pytz`_ library based on
the `Olson tz database`_. See the Credits section for more information.

Time is an illusion we created to rationalize our unbearable
ephemerality and is bound to be imprecise, confusing and flawed. It's
neither your fault or your computer's: accept and embrace its
humanity.

Installing
==========

This program can be installed using ``pip`` from the `PyPI
repository`_, like so::

  pip3 install undertime

The above assumes you're running a distribution that installs the
Python 3 version of ``pip`` as ``pip3``, you might need to replace
that with just ``pip`` on some setups.

This program is also packaged in Debian (since Debian 10 "buster"), so
you can also install it with::

  apt install undertime

If you downloaded this source code and want to install *that*
directly, you can simply run::

  pip3 install .

.. _PyPI repository: https://pypi.org/project/undertime/

Credits
=======

This program was written by Antoine Beaupré and is licensed under the
AGPLv3+. It was inspired by the `overtime-cli`_ program and the
`timeanddate.com`_ site. Another similar tool is `worldchatclock.com`_
and its beautiful round interface. I also found out about `tzdiff`_ a
few months after writing undertime.

I rewrote `overtime-cli`_ in Python because I felt we shouldn't need a
Javascript virtual machine to pick a time. I was also curious to see
how such a rewrite would look like and was tired of loading a web
browser every time I needed to figure out what time it was elsewhere
in the world or when I needed to coordinate international meetings.

All of this wouldn't have been possible without the `pytz`_ library
written by Stuart Bishop, itself based on the `Olson tz database`_
founded by Arthur David Olson and currently maintained by Paul
Eggert. Those packages are shipped to your favorite Debian
distribution by package maintainers who struggle to keep up with those
constant changes so credits should also go to the `tzdata package
maintainers`_ (currently Adam Conrad, Aurelien Jarno, and Clint Adams)
along with everyone in the Debian project keeping all those packages
up to date. Thank you for dealing with humanity's confusing,
beautiful and complex quirks for all of us.
