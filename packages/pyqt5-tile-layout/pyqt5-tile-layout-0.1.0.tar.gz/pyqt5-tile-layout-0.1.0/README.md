# qt-tile-layout

A tile layout for PyQt where you can put any widget in a tile. The user is then able to drag and drop the tiles and resize them

# Quick example

Just launch the ```test.py``` script to have a first look (be sure to have installed PyQt5).
You can have an overview of how to use the different methods in this script.  

Moreover, you can change the value of ```static_layout``` variable to ```False``` to experiment a tile layout where the tile sizes are dynamics with the parent widget size (like a classic layout)

# Create and use a tile layout

First of all, the import statement

```python
from QTileLayout import QTileLayout
```

Then, let's create a tile layout with 8 rows and 5 columns.  
We also give the vertical and horizontal spawn in pixel

```python
layout = QTileLayout(
    rowNumber=8,
    columnNumber=5,
    verticalSpawn=100,
    horizontalSpan=150,
    verticalSpacing=5,
    horizontalSpacing=5,
)
```

We can now add a widget in a specific position: it's the same as the grid layout

```python
layout.addWidget(
    widget=QtWidgets.QLabel('Hello world'),
    fromRow=3,
    fromColumn=2,
    rowSpan=1,
    columnSpan=2
)
```

Finally, if you put your layout into a window, you will be able to drag and drop the above widget and resize its

- ```verticalSpacing() -> int```

_Returns the vertical spacing between two tiles_  
&nbsp;

- ```widgetList() -> list```

_Returns the widgets that are currently in the layout_  
&nbsp;

##### Signals:

- ```tileMoved(QWidget widget, int fromRow, int fromColumn, int toRow, int toColumn)```

_Emits when a tile is moved successfully_  
&nbsp;
