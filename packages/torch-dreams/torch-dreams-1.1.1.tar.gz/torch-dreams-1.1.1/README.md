## Visualizing individual channels

This section of torch_dreams was highly inspired by [Feature visualization by Olah, et al](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/). We basically optimize the input image to maximize activations of a certain channel of a layer in the neural network. 

First, let's select the layer(s) we want to work on. Feel free to play around with other layers. 

```python
layers_to_use = [model.Mixed_6c.branch7x7_1.conv]
```

The next step now would be to define a `custom_func` that would enable use to selectively optimize a single channel. 


```python 
def my_custom_func(layer_outputs):
    loss = layer_outputs[0][7].mean()  ## 7th channel of first layer from layers_to_use
    return loss
```

The rest is actually very similar to the quick start snippet:

```python
config = {
    "image_path": "noise.jpg",
    "layers": layers_to_use,
    "octave_scale": 1.1,  
    "num_octaves": 20,  
    "iterations": 100,  
    "lr": 0.04,
    "max_rotation": 0.7,
    "custom_func":  my_custom_func,
}

out = dreamy_boi.deep_dream(config)
plt.imshow(out)
plt.show()
```
If things go as planned, you will end up with something like:

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mayukhdeb/torch-dreams-notebooks/main/images/raw_output/inceptionv3_channels/inceptionv3.Mixed_6c.branch7x7_1.conv_channel_7.jpg" width = "30%">

## A closer look

The `config` is where we get to customize how exactly we want the optimization to happen. Here's an example without using gradient masks:

```python
config = {
    "image_path": "your_image.jpg",
    "layers": [model.Mixed_6c.branch1x1],
    "octave_scale": 1.2,
    "num_octaves": 10,
    "iterations": 20,
    "lr": 0.03,
    "custom_func": None,
    "max_rotation": 0.5,
    "gradient_smoothing_coeff": 0.1,
    "gradient_smoothing_kernel_size": 3
}
```

* `image_path`: specifies the relative path to the input image. 

* `layers`: List of layers whose outputs are to be "stored" for optimization later on. For example, if we want to use 2 layers:
    ```python
    config["layers"] = [
        model.Mixed_6d.branch1x1,
        model.Mixed_5c
    ]
    ```
    
* `octave_scale`: Factor by which the image is scaled up after each octave. 
* `num_octaves`: Number of times the image is scaled up in order to reach back to the original size.
* `iterations`: Number of gradient ascent steps taken per octave. 
* `lr`: Learning rate used in each step of the gradient ascent. 
* `custom_func` (optional): Use this to build your own custom optimization functions to optimize on individual channels/units/etc.

    For example, if we want to optimize the th **47th channel of the first layer** and the **22nd channel of the 2nd layer** simultaneously:

    ```python
    
    def my_custom_func(layer_outputs):
        loss = layer_outputs[0][47].mean() + layer_outputs[1][22].mean()
        return loss
    config["custom_func"] = my_custom_func
    ```
* `max_rotation` (optional): Caps the maximum rotation to apply on the image.
* `gradient_smoothing_coeff` (optional): Higher -> stronger blurring. 
* `gradient_smoothing_kernel_size`: (optional) Kernel size to be used when applying gaussian blur.

### New in `v1.1.1`
* `add_laplacian` (optional): If set to `True`, it adds the high frequency components from the higher octave into the resulting image. Set it to `True` if you want to preserve the details of the original image as much as possible (especially when using gradient masks)
* `max_roll_x` (optional): sets the maximum amount of random roll the image can undergo at each iteration. 
    * By default, it's set to `None`, which means that the roll values would be a random value between 0 and the width of the image. 
    * Set it to 0 if you want to disable any random roll in this direction. 
* `max_roll_y` (optional): same as `max_roll_x` but in Y direction
