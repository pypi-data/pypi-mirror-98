# üì∫ Control Chromecasts from Linux
`chromecast_mpris` allows you to view and control media playback on casting devices from the Linux desktop.

### Integrations
`chromecast_mpris` controls Chromecasts and casting devices via [MPRIS media player controls](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/2.2/). 

MPRIS is the standard media player interface on Linux desktops. 

MPRIS integration is [enabled by default](https://github.com/KDE/plasma-workspace/tree/master/applets/mediacontroller) in Plasma Desktop, and, along with GNOME's volume control widget, [there are widgets for GNOME](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1379/mpris-indicator-button/), too. [`playerctl` provides a CLI](https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl) for controlling media players through MPRIS.

Check out [‚ñ∂Ô∏èmpris_server](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/mpris_server) if you want to integrate MPRIS support into your media player.

## Installation
### Requirements
 - Linux / *BSD / [macOS](https://github.com/zbentley/dbus-osx-examples)
 - [D-Bus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/)
 - Python >= 3.6
 - [PyGObject](https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/)
 - `requirements.txt`
 
#### Installing PyGObject
On Debian-derived distributions like Ubuntu, install `python3-gi` with `apt`. 
On Arch, you'll want to install `python-gobject`, or install `chromecast_mpris` [directly from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chromecast_mpris/).
On macOS, install [`pygobject3`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pygobject3) via `brew`.

Use `pip` to install `PyGObject>=3.34.0` if there are no installation candidates available in your vendor's package repositories.

### PyPI
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install chromecast_mpris
```

You'll get a `chromecast_mpris` executable added to your `$PATH`.

### GitHub
Check out [the releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris/releases) for stable releases.

If you'd like to use the development branch, clone the repository.

Once you have a source copy, run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, followed by `python3 setup.py install`. 

You'll get a `chromecast_mpris` executable added to your `$PATH`.

### AUR

If you're on Arch, you can install `chromecast_mpris` [directly from the AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chromecast_mpris/).

```bash
$ yay -S chromecast_mpris
```

### Upgrades
Stable releases are uploaded to PyPI. You can upgrade your `chromecast_mpris` installation like so:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip --upgrade chromecast_mpris
```

See the [releases page](https://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris/releases) on GitHub.

## Usage
You'll need to make sure that your computer is on the same network as your devices, and that you're able to make connections to them. 

It also helps to know the names of the devices in advance.

### Launch
Installing the package via PyPI, GitHub or the AUR will add `chromecast_mpris` to your `pip` executables path:
```bash
$ which chromecast_mpris 
~/.local/bin/chromecast_mpris
```

If you have your `pip` executables path added to your shell's `$PATH`, you can launch `chromecast_mpris` like so:
```bash
$ chromecast_mpris
```

You can also launch `chromecast_mpris` via its Python module. This can be useful if your `$PATH` doesn't point to your `pip` executables.
```bash
$ python3 -m chromecast_mpris
```

### Help
```bash
$ chromecast_mpris --help
Usage: chromecast_mpris [OPTIONS]

  Control casting devices via Linux media controls and desktops.

  This daemon connects your casting device directly to the D-Bus media
  player interface.

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT         Connect to a device via its name, otherwise control
                          the first device found.

  -h, --host TEXT         Connect to a device via its hostname or IP address,
                          otherwise control the first device found.

  -u, --uuid TEXT         Connect to a device via its UUID, otherwise control
                          the first device found

  -w, --wait FLOAT        Seconds to wait between trying to make initial
                          successful connections to a device.

  -r, --retry-wait FLOAT  Seconds to wait between reconnection attempts if a
                          successful connection is interrupted.  [default:
                          5.0]

  -i, --icon              Use a lighter icon instead of the dark icon. The
                          lighter icon goes well with dark themes.  [default:
                          False]

  -l, --log-level TEXT    Set the debugging log level.  [default: WARN]
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

### Connect to a device
Connect to a device named "My Device" and run `chromecast_mpris` in the background.
```bash
$ chromecast_mpris --name "My Device" &
[1] 1234
```

After launching `chromecast_mpris`, you can use any MPRIS client to interact with it. MPRIS support is built in directly to Plasma Desktop and GNOME 3, and you can use `playerctl` on the command-line. 

### Retry until a Chromecast is found
You can use the `-w/--wait` flag to specify a waiting period in seconds before `chromecast_mpris` will try to find a casting device again if one is not found initially.

For example, if you want to wait 60 seconds between scans for devices, you can run the following:
```bash
$ export SECONDS=60
$ chromecast_mpris --wait $SECONDS
```

This is useful if you'd like to start `chromecast_mpris` at login, and there is a chance that your device isn't on, or you're on a different network. 

### Open a URI on a Chromecast
 Get the D-Bus name for your device using `playerctl`.
```bash
$ playerctl --list-all
My_Device
```

Use the D-Bus name to issue commands to it.
```bash
$ export URL="http://ccmixter.org/content/gmz/gmz_-_Parametaphoriquement.mp3"
$ playerctl --player My_Device open "$URL"
```

This will play a song on your device.

### Open a YouTube video
You can cast YouTube videos the same way you can cast a generic URI.
```bash
$ export VIDEO="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4nkgJdVZFA"
$ playerctl --player My_Device open "$VIDEO"
```
