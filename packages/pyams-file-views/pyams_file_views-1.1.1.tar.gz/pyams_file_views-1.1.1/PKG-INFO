        What is PyAMS?
        ==============
        
        PyAMS (Pyramid Application Management Suite) is a small suite of packages written for applications
        and content management with the Pyramid framework.
        
        **PyAMS** is actually mainly used to manage web sites through content management applications (CMS,
        see PyAMS_content package), but many features are generic and can be used inside any kind of web
        application.
        
        All PyAMS documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs <https://pyams.readthedocs.io>`_; source code
        is available on `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com/pyams>`_ and pushed to `Github
        <https://github.com/py-ams>`_. Doctests are available in the *doctests* source folder.
        
        
        What is PyAMS file views?
        =========================
        
        PyAMS file is a package dedicated to files management, including images.
        
        This package is adding views and content providers and a management interface to manage files and
        images through dedicated forms widgets which are integrated into PyAMS_skin and PyAMS_zmi
        packages (but using PyAMS_zmi is not a requirement).
