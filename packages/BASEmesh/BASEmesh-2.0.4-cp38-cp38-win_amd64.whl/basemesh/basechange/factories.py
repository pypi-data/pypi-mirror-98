    Attributes
    ----------
    dist_cs : float
        Distance between two cross sections in the channel.
    num_cs : int
        Number of cross sections in the channel
    bed_width : float
        The width of the channel bed.
    height : float
        The total height of the channel. This, together with
        :attr:`bank_slope`, controls the total width of the channel.
    bed_slope : float
        The rise-over-run slope of the channel.
    bank_slope : float
        The rise-over-run slope of the channel banks. This, together
        with :attr:`height`, controls the total width of the channel.
    friction_bed : float
        Strickler friction value for the channel bed.
    friction_bank : float
        Strickler friction value for the channel banks.
    midpoint_shift : float, optional
        Relative position of the nodes located in the middle of the
        channel banks. Lower values move these nodes closer to the
        channel bed, higher values move them towards the outer edge of
        the channel.
        Allowed values are 0.0 to 1.0 (exclusive). Defaults to 0.5.
    cross_sections : int, optional
        The number of cross sections to generate. Defaults to 20.
    raise_by : float, optional
        The starting elevation of the channel origin. Use this if you
        want to keep elevations positive. Defaults to 0.
