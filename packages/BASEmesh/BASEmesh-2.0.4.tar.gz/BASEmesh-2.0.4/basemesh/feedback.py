class Feedback:
    """Generic interface for interacting with long-running functions.

    This class allows functions performing long-running operations
    (aka. LROs, generally anything over 1-2 seconds of blocking time)
    to communicate with their caller.

    The function can share its currents status using the
    Feedback.update() method. For processes of unknown length (such as
    network activity or external programs), you can use the
    Feedback.busy() context manager.

    If your workload supports cancellation, be sure to check the
    Feedback.is_cancelled flag as often as is sensible. It is set when
    the caller requests the termination of the operation.

    The callback function provided as part of the initialiser will be
    passed three positional arguments: a float between 0.0 and 1.0 that
    signifies the progress of the function, a status string, and a
    Boolean flag that shows whether the function flagged itself as busy
    (i.e. working but unable to give progress updates).
