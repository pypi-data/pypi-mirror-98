"""1D channel generator and processor for BASEmesh.

This module adds support for 1D channels to BASEmesh. These channels
are represented through the :class:`ChannelGeometry` class, which is in
turn made up of :class:`CrossSection` instances.

It also features a number of built-in factories used to simplify the
generation of arbitrary cross sections.

Additionally, 1D geometries may be exported to 2D meshes via the
:meth:`ChannelGeometry.to_mesh()` method.
