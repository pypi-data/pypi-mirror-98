## What is it?
This is a Python Noodle Extensions Editor for Beat Saber levels. Manually editing a JSON file over a long period of time can get really annoying, so this should speed up the process!\

## Sample
```py
import noodleExtensions as NE

editor = NE.NoodleExtensions(r"level.datpath")

# assign to a new track
dropNote = NE.Note(5, 1, 0, 0, 8)
editor.editNote(dropNote, NE.Note(5, 1, 0, 0, 8, _track="FallDownTrack"))

FallDownTrack = NE.AnimateTrack(2, "FallDownTrack", 2, _position=[
  [0, 100, 0, 0], # be in the sky before it appears
  [0, 0, 0, 0.75, "easeOutBounce"], # fall down in front of player and finish animation just in time for the player to hit it
])
editor.animateTrack(FallDownTrack)

# push events to the level.dat so it can be ready to play
editor.pushChanges()
```
