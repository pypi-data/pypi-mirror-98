''' This module exposes support for DataframeStream, that use can used like:

.. code:: python

    # create a builder, then seal it as stream
    >>> builder = DataframeStreamBuilder(client)
    >>> stream = builder.seal(client)
    >>> stream
    >>> <vineyard._C.DataframeStream at 0x13b3d7ef0>

    # use write to put chunks
    >>> writer = stream.open_writer()
    >>> chunk = reader.next(1000)
    >>> chunk
    <pyarrow.lib.Buffer at 0x13b3e35f0>
    >>> len(chunk)
    1234
    >>> chunk.is_mutable
    True

    # mark the stream as finished
    >>> writer.finish()

    # open a reader
    >>> reader = stream.open_reader(client)
    >>> chunk = reader.next()
    >>> chunk
    <pyarrow.lib.Buffer at 0x13c8a00f0>
    >>> len(chunk)
    1234

    # the reader reaches the end of the stream
    >>> chunk = reader.next()
