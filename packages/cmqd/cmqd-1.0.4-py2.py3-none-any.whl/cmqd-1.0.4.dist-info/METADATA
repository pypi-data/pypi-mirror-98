## Installation

To use the package, run:

```sh
pip install --upgrade cmqd
```

## Examples

Selection of examples; a reference point of getting started.

```
// Instantiate a client
>>> from clearmacro import Client
>>> config = {'url': '<HOST HERE>', 'username': '<EMAIL HERE>', 'password': '<PASSWORD HERE>'}
>>> client = Client(**config)

// Get the catalogue
>>> catalogue = client.get_signals_catalogue()

// Consume it as a DataFrame
