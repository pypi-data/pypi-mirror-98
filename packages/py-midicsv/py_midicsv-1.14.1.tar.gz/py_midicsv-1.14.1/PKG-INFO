A Python library inspired by the [midicsv](http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/) tool created by John Walker. Its main purpose is to bidirectionally convert between the binary `MIDI` format and a human-readable interpretation of the contained data in text format, expressed as `CSV`.
If you found this library, you probably already know why you need it.


## Installation

`py_midicsv` can be installed via pip:
```bash
$ pip install py_midicsv
```

Alternatively you can build the package by cloning this repository and installing via [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/timwedde/py_midicsv.git
$ cd py_midicsv/
$ poetry install
```


## Usage

### As a Command Line Tool
```bash
Usage: midicsv [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

  Convert MIDI files to CSV files.

  midicsv reads a standard MIDI file and decodes it into a CSV file which
  preserves all the information in the MIDI file. The ASCII CSV file may be
  loaded into a spreadsheet or database application, or processed by a
  program to transform the MIDI data (for example, to key transpose a
  composition or extract a track from a multi-track sequence). A CSV file in
  the format created by midicsv may be converted back into a standard MIDI
  file with the csvmidi program.

  Specify an input file and an output file to process it. Either argument
  can be stdin/stdout.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

```bash
Usage: csvmidi [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE

  Convert CSV files to MIDI files.

  csvmidi reads a CSV file in the format written by midicsv and creates the
  equivalent standard MIDI file.

  Specify an input file and an output file to process it. Either argument
  can be stdin/stdout.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

### As a Library
```python
import py_midicsv as pm

# Load the MIDI file and parse it into CSV format
csv_string = pm.midi_to_csv("example.mid")

with open("example_converted.csv", "w") as f:
    f.writelines(csv_string)

# Parse the CSV output of the previous command back into a MIDI file
midi_object = pm.csv_to_midi(csv_string)

# Save the parsed MIDI file to disk
with open("example_converted.mid", "wb") as output_file:
    midi_writer = pm.FileWriter(output_file)
    midi_writer.write(midi_object)
```

## Documentation
A full explanation of the `midicsv` file format can be found [here](https://github.com/timwedde/py_midicsv/blob/master/doc/file-format.md).

## Differences

This library adheres as much as possible to how the original library works, however generated files are not guaranteed to be entirely identical when compared bit-by-bit.
This is mostly due to the handling of meta-event data, especially lyric events, since the encoding scheme has changed. The original library did not encode some of the characters in the Latin-1 set, while this version does.
