Pulling
=============
Pulling is an open source python repository for working with files of different extensions. Documentation in English can be found here - https://github.com/ItYaS/pulling/wiki.
The repository now supports .txt .rtf .pdf .docx .csv .avro .json formats.

Install
======================
To start using the repository, first install python from this - https://www.python.org/downloads/.
After that, install the pulling package through the console.

> pip install pulling

You can see examples of the use of pulling in test/pulling_test.py

Version 1.4
======================
- The code readability was also fixed and all unnecessary loops were removed.
- Fixed bugs and architecture
- Removed unnecessary code
- Improved readability and usability
- Corrected errors in the documentation

Future
======================
Such a repository can be extended for life. That's what I will do. But the next version (where there will be parsing from other formats) will not be released soon, because in 2020 and 2021, I am preparing for exams and admission to the Institute. So, keep this repository and be patient.

In the future, I want to parse .orc .rcf .parquet .feather (and one day .doc .odt), add conversion to other extensions for all formats, add new functions, and new formats.
