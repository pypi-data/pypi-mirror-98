@dataclass
class FlightPoint:
    """
    Dataclass for storing data for one flight point.

    This class is meant for:

    - pandas friendliness: data exchange with pandas DataFrames is simple
    - extensibility: any user might add fields to the **class** using :meth:`add_field`

    **Exchanges with pandas DataFrame**

        A pandas DataFrame can be generated from a list of FlightPoint instances::

            >>> import pandas as pd
            >>> from fastoad.base.flight_point import FlightPoint

            >>> fp1 = FlightPoint(mass=70000., altitude=0.)
            >>> fp2 = FlightPoint(mass=60000., altitude=10000.)
            >>> df = pd.DataFrame([fp1, fp2])

        And FlightPoint instances can be created from DataFrame rows::

            # Get one FlightPoint instance from a DataFrame row
            >>> fp1bis = FlightPoint.create(df.iloc[0])

            # Get a list of FlightPoint instances from the whole DataFrame
            >>> flight_points = FlightPoint.create_list(df)

    **Extensibility**

        FlightPoint class is bundled with several fields that are commonly used in trajectory
        assessment, but one might need additional fields.

        Python allows to add attributes to any instance at runtime, but for FlightPoint to run
        smoothly, especially when exchanging data with pandas, you have to work at class level.
        This can be done using :meth:`add_field`, preferably outside of any class or function::

            # Adds a float field with None as default value
            >>> FlightPoint.add_field("ion_drive_power")

            # Adds a field and define its type and default value
            >>> FlightPoint.add_field("warp", annotation_type=int, default_value=9)

            # Now these fields can be used at instantiation
            >>> fp = FlightPoint(ion_drive_power=110.0, warp=12)

            # Removes a field, even an original one (useful only to avoid having it in outputs)
            >>> FlightPoint.remove_field("sfc")

    .. note::

        All parameters in FlightPoint instances are expected to be in SI units.
