    # Rationale:
    #   The idea here is to populate the options at `setup()` time while keeping
    #   all the operations that are in the original `setup()` of the class.
    #
    #   This could have been done by making all our OpenMDAO classes inherit from
    #   a base class where the option values are retrieved, but modifying each
    #   OpenMDAO class looks overkill. Moreover, it would add to them a dependency
    #   to FAST-OAD after having avoided to introduce dependencies outside OpenMDAO.
    #   Last but not least, we would need future contributor to stick to this practice
    #   of inheritance.
    #
    #   Therefore, the most obvious alternative is a decorator. In this decorator, we
    #   could have produced a new instance of the same class that has its own `setup()`
    #   that calls the original `setup()` (i.e. the original Decorator pattern AIUI)
    #   but the new instance would be out of iPOPO's scope.
    #   So we just modify the original instance where we need to "replace"
    #   the `setup()` method to have our code called automagically, without losing the
    #   initial code of `setup()` where there is probably important things. So the trick
    #   is to rename the original `setup()` as `__setup_before_option_decorator()`, and create a
    #   new `setup()` that does its job and then calls `__setup_before_option_decorator()`.
