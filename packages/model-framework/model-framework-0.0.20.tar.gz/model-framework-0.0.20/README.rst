What is 'model-framework'?
==========================

..
    ----------

Model-framework is a framework to build simple to use Python interfaces for complex models. For instance, a structural analysis tool (like `FramAT <https://github.com/airinnova/framat>`_) requires a number of user inputs parameters, for instance, for general settings, material or loads. It can be cumbersome to develop a consistent user interface for such a tool which has a large number of settings. Model-framework helps to build good Python user API's for complex models. In particular it aims to improve the following aspects of the developer and user experiences.

* Providing a simple to understand Python API to build and interact with complex models
* Enforcing API consistency
* User input validation
* Full API documentation through automatic documentation generation
* Flexible model extensibility
* Clear separation between user input and solution routines

..
