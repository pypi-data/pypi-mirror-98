Description: # Artist
        ## Motivation
        - An easy to edit codebase for Progressive GAN originally published by this [research paper][Progressive GAN Research Paper] and other GANs
        - Supplement my personal projects
        - Resume builder
        - For fun and to understand state-of-the-art AI
        
        ## Installation
        #### CUDA Installation
        Ensure you have a GPU if you want to train in any reasonable amount of time.
        - [Install CUDA here][CUDA Install]
        - [Install cuDNN here][cuDNN Install]
        #### Project Installation
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Fatima-x-Nikhil/Artist.git
        cd Artist
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install --no-cache-dir --pre torch torchvision torchaudio -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu112/torch_nightly.html
        cd src/models
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Running the program
        To train the program, run the "Train.ipynb" notebook and alter your parameters at will.
        There should be sufficient in-code documentation for you to understand what the hell is going on
