    There can be as many Confluence instances as needed.

    This class depends on the public **requests** library.  It also

    #::zabel.commons.exceptions, #::zabel.commons.sessions,
    and #::zabel.commons.utils.

    A non-admin interface (no API for user&group admin features) to
    Confluence.

    Groups and users are defined on Jira or Crowd.  Changes can take up
    to one hour to propagate.

    # Implemented features

    - groups&users
    - pages
    - search
    - spaces

    What is accessible through the API depends on account rights.

    Whenever applicable, the provided features handle pagination (i.e.,
    they return all relevant elements, not only the first n).

    # Sample use

    ```python
    >>> from zabel.elements.clients import Confluence
    >>>
    >>> url = 'https://confluence.example.com'
    >>> confluence = Confluence(url, user, token)
    >>> confluence.list_users()
    ```
