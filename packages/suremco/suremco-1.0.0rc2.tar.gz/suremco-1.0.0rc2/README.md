# Installation

Compilation of the tracker has only been tested with Ubuntu Linux (among others, the `g++ g++-mingw-w64-x86-64` packages might be needed), where it is cross-compiled for Windows as well.

To just use SurEmCo, it is recommended to install it via Anaconda (the additional `conda-forge` channel needs to be activated beforehand (`conda config --add channels conda-forge`):
```
> conda install -yc modsim suremco
```

It can then be started via
```
> python -m suremco
# or with filenames
> python -m suremco dia_image.png snsmil_output.txt
```
