    Estimate a covariance matrix given data.

    Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
    If we examine N-dimensional samples, `X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`,
    then the covariance matrix element `C_{ij}` is the covariance of
    `x_i` and `x_j`. The element `C_{ii}` is the variance of `x_i`.

    Args:
        m: A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
            Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
            observation of all those variables.
        rowvar: If `rowvar` is True, then each row represents a
            variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the
            relationship is transposed: each column represents a variable,
            while the rows contain observations.

    Returns:
        The covariance matrix of the variables.

      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
