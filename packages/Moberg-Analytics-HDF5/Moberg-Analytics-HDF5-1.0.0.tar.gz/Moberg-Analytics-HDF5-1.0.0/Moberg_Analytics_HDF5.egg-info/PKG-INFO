Description: # Moberg Analytics HDF5 Functions
        
        This package provides user-friendly functions organized into Classes for reading [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) file content and components into Python. It is built on top of the [h5py package](https://www.h5py.org/) which interfaces directly with the HDF5 file. 
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the Moberg-Analytics-HDF5 package from [PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/Moberg-Analytics-HDF5/):
        
            pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ Moberg-Analytics-HDF5
            
        This package was created using Python version 3.9.0.
        
        ## How to use
        
        1 - Import the hdf5_tools module from moberg_analytics_hdf5 package into Python:
        	
        	from moberg_analytics_hdf5 import hdf5_tools
        	
        2 - Select the path to the HDF5 file:
        
        	hdf5_filepath = r"path to the hdf5 file"
        	
        3 - Instantiate the HDF5Content, HDF5Components, and/or the HDF5Helper class:
        
        -The HDF5Content class contains functions that organize the content of the HDF5 file into lists and dictionaries.
        
        -The HDF5Components class contains functions that return various components of the HDF5 file such as
        groups, datasets, dataset values, NumPy/Pandas matrices of dataset values, metadata attributes, and structured dictionaries.
        
        -The HDF5Helper class contains functions for argument, group, dataset, and duplicate checks and adds additional functionality to the HDF5Content and HDF5Components classes.
        
        	hdf5_content = hdf5_tools.HDF5Content(hdf5_filepath=hdf5_filepath)
        	
        	hdf5_comps = hdf5_tools.HDF5Components(hdf5_filepath=hdf5_filepath)
        	
        	hdf5_helper = hdf5_tools.HDF5Helper()
        	
        4 - Use the functions as detailed in the documentation below.
