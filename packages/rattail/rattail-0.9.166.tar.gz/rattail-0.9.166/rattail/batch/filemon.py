        Make a batch from the given file path.

        :param path: Path to the source data file for the batch.

        :param type: Type of batch, specified by the batch "key" - e.g. 'labels'.

        :param handler: Spec string for the batch handler class, e.g.
           ``'rattail.batch.handheld.handler:HandheldBatchHandler'``.  Note

           auto-deleted in the event that it has no data rows, after being

           auto-execution of new batches.  Default behavior is for the handler
           to decide whether each batch is eligible for auto-execution.  Note
