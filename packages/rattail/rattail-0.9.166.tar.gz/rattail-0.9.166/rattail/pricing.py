    Calculate and return a gross margin percentage based on ``price`` and
    ``cost``.

    Please note, that for historical reasons, the default behavior is to return
    the margin as a decimal value from 0.0 through 100.0 (or beyond, perhaps).

    However the "industry standard" seems to be to use a decimal value between
    0.000 and 1.000 instead.  Specify ``percentage=True`` for this behavior.

    If ``price`` is empty (or zero), returns ``None``.

    If ``cost`` is empty (or zero), returns ``100`` (or ``1`` if
    ``percentage=True``).
