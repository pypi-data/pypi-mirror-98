       Any proper report definition should assign a "globally unique" value to
       this attribute.  In practice that means you should prefix the value with
       something specific to your org, e.g. ``'acme_'``.

       This should be a human-recognizable name for the report.  It is
       (usually) saved along with the report output.

       Unfortunately for now, the framework doesn't know how to order the
       report params, to match their definition in code.  So in the meantime
       you must explicitly declare this in ``param_sequence``.
