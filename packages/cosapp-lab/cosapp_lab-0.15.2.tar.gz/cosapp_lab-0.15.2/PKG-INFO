Description: # CosApp Lab - Toolbox for managing and deploying CoSApp powered dashboards.
        
        
        
        ## Introduction
        
        
        The primary goal of **CoSApp Lab** is to help users transform existing CoSApp 
        modules into interactive dashboards, with almost no additional development or
        configuration.
        
        
        ### Examples
        
        
        
        #### Using CosApp Lab in JupyterLab
        
        CoSApp Lab provides a JupyterLab extension named **SysExplorer** creating interactive dashboards. This extension allows users to dynamically customize the layout and fill their dashboard with multiple predefined widgets, such as charts, controllers (sliders, *etc.*), 3D visualization panels...

        #### Using CosApp Lab standalone mode
        
        Dashboards defined with **SysExplorer** in JupyterLab can also be exported into libraries and served by CoSApp Lab as web applications.

        ## Documentation
        
        A more detailed **CoSApp Lab** documentation is available at:
        
        https://cosapp-lab.readthedocs.io/
           
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        
        ### Stable release
        
        
        The easiest way to obtain `cosapp_lab` is to install the conda package:
        
        ```shell
        conda install cosapp_lab
        ``` 
        
        `cosapp_lab` is also available on PyPI. However, since `pythonocc-core` is not, users can install `cosapp_lab` with *pip*, but the 3D viewer widget will not work.
        
        ```shell
        pip install cosapp-lab
        ``` 
        
        `JupyterLab` is not a direct dependency of `cosapp_lab`, but users need to have JupyterLab (>3.0) in order to create CoSApp dashboard in notebooks.  
        
        ### Development
        
        
        
        #### Setup development environment
        
        
        ```shell
            # create a new conda environment
            conda create -n cosapplab -c conda-forge python jupyterlab nodejs
            conda activate cosapplab
        
            # download cosapp_lab from gitlab
            git clone --recursive https://gitlab.com/cosapp/cosapp_lab.git
        
            # install JS dependencies, build and install JupyterLab extension in development mode 
            cd cosapp_lab
            jlpm install
            jlpm build:all
            jlpm install:extension
        
            # install cosapp_lab in editable mode
            python -m pip install -e .
        ``` 
        
        
        #### Testing
        
        ```shell
            # Test python code
            python -m pytest
        
            # Test typescript code
            jlpm test
        ``` 
        
        
        
        #### Build documents
        
        
        ```shell
        cd docs
        sphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees . _build
        ```
