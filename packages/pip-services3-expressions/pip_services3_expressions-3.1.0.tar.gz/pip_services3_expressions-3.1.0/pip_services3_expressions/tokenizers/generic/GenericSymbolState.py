class GenericSymbolState(ISymbolState):
    """
    The idea of a symbol is a character that stands on its own, such as an ampersand or a parenthesis.
    For example, when tokenizing the expression **(is_ready)& (is_willing) **, a typical
    tokenizer would return 7 tokens, including one for each parenthesis and one for the ampersand.
    Thus a series of symbols such as **)&( ** becomes three tokens, while a series of letters
    such as **is_ready** becomes a single word token.

    Multi-character symbols are an exception to the rule that a symbol is a standalone character.  
    For example, a tokenizer may want less-than-or-equals to tokenize as a single token. This class
    provides a method for establishing which multi-character symbols an object of this class should
    treat as single symbols. This allows, for example, **"cat &lt;= dog"** to tokenize as 
    three tokens, rather than splitting the less-than and equals symbols into separate tokens.

    By default, this state recognizes the following multi-character symbols:
    **!=, :-, &lt;=, &gt;=**
