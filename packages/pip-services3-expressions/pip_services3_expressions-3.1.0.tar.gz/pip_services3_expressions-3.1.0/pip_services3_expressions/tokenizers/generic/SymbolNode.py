class SymbolNode:
    """
    A **SymbolNode** object is a member of a tree that contains all possible prefixes
    of allowable symbols. Multi-character symbols appear in a **SymbolNode** tree
    with one node for each character.

    For example, the symbol **=:~** will appear in a tree as three nodes. The first
    node contains an equals sign, and has a child; that child contains a colon and has a child;
    this third child contains a tilde, and has no children of its own. If the colon node had
    another child for a dollar sign character, then the tree would contain the symbol **=:$**.

    A tree of **SymbolNode** objects collaborate to read a (potentially multi-character)
    symbol from an input stream. A root node with no character of its own finds an initial node
    that represents the first character in the input. This node looks to see if the next character
    in the stream matches one of its children. If so, the node delegates its reading task to its child.
    This approach walks down the tree, pulling symbols from the input that match the path down the tree.

    When a node does not have a child that matches the next character, we will have read the longest
    possible symbol prefix. This prefix may or may not be a valid symbol.
    Consider a tree that has had **=:~** added and has not had **=:** added.
    In this tree, of the three nodes that contain **=:~**, only the first and third contain
    complete symbols. If, say, the input contains **=:a**, the colon node will not have
    a child that matches the 'a' and so it will stop reading. The colon node has to "unread": it must
    push back its character, and ask its parent to unread. Unreading continues until it reaches
    an ancestor that represents a valid symbol.
