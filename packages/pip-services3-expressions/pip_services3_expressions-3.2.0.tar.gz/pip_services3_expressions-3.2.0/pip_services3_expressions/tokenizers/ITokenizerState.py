    """
    A tokenizerState returns a token, given a scanner, an initial character read from the scanner,
    and a tokenizer that is conducting an overall tokenization of the scanner. The tokenizer will
    typically have a character state table that decides which state to use, depending on an initial 
    character. If a single character is insufficient, a state such as **SlashState**
    will read a second character, and may delegate to another state, such as **SlashStarState**.
    This prospect of delegation is the reason that the :func:`next_token()`
    method has a tokenizer argument.
