features:
  - |
    Add the ``--prompt`` option for the CLI which will cause the user to be
    prompted to enter a password. Any password otherwise specified by
    ``--key`` , ``--os-password`` or an environment variable will be ignored.

  - |
    Added bash completion support to the ``swift`` CLI. Enable this by sourcing
    the included ``tools/swift.bash_completion`` file. Make it permanent by
    including this file in the system's ``/etc/bash_completion.d`` directory.

  - |
    Add ability to generate a temporary URL with an IP range restriction.
    TempURLs with IP restrictions are supported are Swift 2.19.0 or later.

  - |
    The client.py SDK now supports a ``query_string`` option on the
    ``head_object()`` method. This is useful for finding information on
    SLO/DLO manifests without fetching the entire manifest.

  - |
    The client.py SDK now respects ``region_name`` when using sessions.

  - |
    Added a ``.close()`` method to an object response, allowing clients to give
    up on reading the rest of the response body, if they so choose.

  - |
    Fixed a bug where using ``--debug`` in the CLI with unicode account names
    would cause a client crash.

  - |
    Make OS_AUTH_URL work in DevStack (for testing) by default.

  - |
    Dropped Python 3.4 testing.

  - |
    Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
