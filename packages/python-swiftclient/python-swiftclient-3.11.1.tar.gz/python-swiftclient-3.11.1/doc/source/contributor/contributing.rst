For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the
accounts you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how
we communicate as a community, etc.

The python-swiftclient is maintained by the OpenStack Swift project.
