        **A python toolkit for the analyis of lipid membrane simulations**

        Overview
        ========
        
        **lipyphilic** is a set of tools for analysing MD simulations of lipid bilayers. It is an object-oriented
        Python package built directly on top of `MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/>`__, and makes use of
        `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`__, `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`__ and `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ for
        efficient computation. The analysis classes are designed with the same interface as those of MDAnalysis -
        so if you know how to `use analysis modules in
        MDAnalysis <https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/examples/quickstart.html#Analysis>`__ then you know how
        to use **lipyphilic**!
         
        Analysis tools in **lipyphilic** include: identifying sterol flip-flop events, calculating domain registration over time,
        and calculating local lipid compositions. These tools position **lipyphilic** as complementary to, rather than
        competing against, existing membrane analysis software such as `MemSurfer <https://github.com/LLNL/MemSurfer>`__ and
        `FatSlim <http://fatslim.github.io/>`__.
        
        Check out the `Basic Usage <https://lipyphilic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html>`__ example to see how to use
        **lipyphilic**, and see the `Analysis tools <https://lipyphilic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/analyses.html>`__ 
        section for detailed information and exmaples on each tool.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install **lipyphilic** along with its dependencies is through `Conda
        <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html>`__::
        
            conda config --add channels conda-forge
            conda install lipyphilic
        
        See the `installation guide <https://lipyphilic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html>`__ for futher information.
        
        Citing
        ======
        
        If you use **lipyphilic** in your project, please cite `MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/citations/>`__ and
        if you use the Area Per Lipid tool please also cite `Freud <https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/citing.html>`__.
        
        There is currently no paper describing **lipyphilic**, but we're working on it. In the meantime, if you like what we
        do, please tell everyone you know to check out **lipyphilic**! And if there are things you think we could improve, features
        you would like to see added, or pesky bugs that need to be fixed, please raise an issue on
        `github <https://github.com/p-j-smith/lipyphilic/issues>`__.
