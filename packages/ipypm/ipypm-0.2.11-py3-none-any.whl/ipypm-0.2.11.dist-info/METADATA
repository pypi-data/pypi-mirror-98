The ``pyPM.ca`` population modeller (www.pyPM.ca) describes connected systems with
discrete-time difference equations. It was developed specifically
to understand and characterize the CoViD-19 epidemic. 

This package, ipypm, is a convenient graphical user interface (GUI) for
pyPM.ca based in interactive python widgets for use inside a Jupyter notebook.
After opening the GUI in a notebook, the user can open a pyPM.ca model
and compare its predictions with data.
Models and data can be accessed on the local filesystem or downloaded
from a network server.
The model parameters can be adjusted manually or by fitting to data.
Models can be examined in detail and modified through the GUI, without
programming.
