"""
A collection of filters to use with QGraphs.

A QGraph is a partially ordered infinite list of graphs with some constraints on the actual structure of the graphs.

One way to tune these constraints is to filter the QGraph with one or more filters from this package.

# Consider only graphs that are two deep and involve the "x" register.
> qgraph = qgraph.filter(feyn.filters.Depth(2))
> qgraph = qgraph.filter(feyn.filters.Contains("x"))
> qgraph.fit(data)

Notice that QGraph filters can be chained, and will be and'ed together.

This module has a useful collection of filters. It's also possible to define custom filters by deriving from the QGraphFilter baseclass

    Notice that this example demonstrates searching for all graphs that involve 'x' plus zero or one of the other input features.

    Using this chained filter approach it's possible to guide the search for non-linear and dynamic correlations in your dataset with the output variable.
