class QGraph:
    """
    A QGraph is extracted from the QLattice with the `QLattice.get_regressor()` or the `QLattice.get_classifier` method. It represents infinite list of graphs linking a set of input registers to an output register.

    One way to think about a QGraph is as a partially ordered list of all possible graphs complying with some constraints. The head of the list contains the best graphs found for solving a problem at any given time.

    A QGraph can be gradually sorted by fitting it to one or more datasets. Fitting is done using one of two methods, the `fit` method which searches further and further into the infinite list for better graphs, and the `sort` method which merely re-sorts the head of the list with new conditions.

    Since the list is infinite, the sorting can never actually finish, but using the QLattice simulator, the QGraph can be extremely smart about how and where in the infinite list to search for better graphs.

    It is possible to limit or constrain which graphs belong in the infinite list in several ways, most importantly using the `filter` method.

    The constructor is for internal use. QGraphs should always be generated with the `QLattice.get_graph` method.

        Fit and sort the `QGraph` with the given data set. After the fitting, the head of the QGraph will be sorted by increasing loss.

        Each call will further explore the infinite list of graphs, and may find better graphs that are then brought forward to their correct sorting order. Sometimes this leads to a new best graph making it to the first position in the list.

        A call to fit() is comparable to an epoch in other frameworks. Every call will potentially lead to a new best graph being found. Since the list is infinite, there is always the possibility that a new superior graph is found, but in practice between 5 and 100 calls are usually sufficient.

        The n_samples parameter controls how much each graph in the QGraph is trained during the process. The default behavior is to train each graph once with each sample in the dataset, unless the set is smaller than 10000, in which case the dataset will be upsampled to 10000 samples before fitting.

        The samples are shuffled randomly before fitting to avoid issues with the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm.

        The recommended workflow for fitting a QGraph involves several steps in a loop:
        > for epoch in range(10):
        >     qgraph.fit(train)       # fit the data to the training set
        >     best = qgraph.best()    # get a list of the best performing graphs
        >     qlattice.update(best)   # update the qlattice with the best graphs

        Arguments:
            data -- Training data including both input and expected values. Can be either a dict mapping register names to value arrays, or a pandas.DataFrame.
            n_samples -- Number of samples to fit on. The samples will be taken from `data`, possibly over- or undersampling the data. Passing `None` means use every sample in the dataset or 10000 samples, whichever is larger.
            loss_function -- Name of the loss function or the function itself. This is the loss function to use for fitting. Can either be a string or one of the functions provided in `feyn.losses`.
            show -- Controls status display. If specified, it should be either "graph", "text", or a user-defined callback function which receives the best graph found so far, along with it's loss.
            threads -- Number of concurrent threads to use for fitting. Choose this number to match the number of CPU cores on your machine.
            sample_weights -- An optional numpy array of weights for each sample. If present, the array must have the same size as the data set, i.e. one weight for each sample
            criterion -- Sort by information criterion rather than loss. Either "aic", "bic" or None
