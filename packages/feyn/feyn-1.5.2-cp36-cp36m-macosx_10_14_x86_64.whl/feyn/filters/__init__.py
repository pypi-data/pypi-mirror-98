"""
A collection of filters to use with QGraphs.

A QGraph is a partially ordered infinite list of graphs with some constraints on the actual structure of the graphs.

One way to tune these constraints is to filter the QGraph with one or more filters from this package.

# Consider only graphs that are two deep and involve the "x" register.
> qgraph = qgraph.filter(feyn.filters.Depth(2))
> qgraph = qgraph.filter(feyn.filters.Contains("x"))
> qgraph.fit(data)

Notice that QGraph filters can be chained, and will be and'ed together.

This module has a useful collection of filters. It's also possible to define custom filters by deriving from the QGraphFilter baseclass
