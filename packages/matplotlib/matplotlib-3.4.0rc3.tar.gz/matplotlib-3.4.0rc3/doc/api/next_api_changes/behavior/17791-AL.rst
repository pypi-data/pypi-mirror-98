Harmonized key event data across backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The different backends wth key translation support, now handle 'shift'
as a sometimes modifier, where the 'shift' prefix won't be added if a
key translation was made.

The *matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5.SPECIAL_KEYS* dictionary contains
keys that do *not* return their unicode name instead they have
manually specified names. The name for *QtCore.Qt.Key_Meta* has
changed to 'meta' to be consistent with the other GUI backends.

The WebAgg backend now handles key translations correctly on non-US
keyboard layouts.


**GTK/Tk key name changes**

The handling of non-ASCII keypresses (as reported in the KeyEvent passed to
``key_press_event``-handlers) in the GTK and Tk backends now correctly reports
Unicode characters (e.g., â‚¬), and better respects NumLock on the numpad.

The following key names have changed; the new names are consistent with those
reported by the Qt backends:

- The "Break/Pause" key (keysym 0xff13) is now reported as "pause" instead of
  "break" (this is also consistent with the X key name).
- The numpad "delete" key is now reported as "delete" instead of "dec".
