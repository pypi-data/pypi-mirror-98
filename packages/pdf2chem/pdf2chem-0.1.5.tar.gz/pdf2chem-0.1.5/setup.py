Other outputs (e.g., InChI or other known names for the chemical) are possible and may be incorporated into future versions.\n\n- The package should automatically detect local vs. hosted runtimes and choose the compatible pdf extraction method in textract.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- The package directly uses cirpy, ChemDataExtractor, pandas, os, re, time, datetime, and sys in addition to native Python 3.  Many of these in turn have a fair few dependencies of their own.\n\n## Usage\n\n- Place pdf files of interest (typically journal articles) in an accessible folder.\nExecute p2c.curate_folder()\nIf the files are not in the current directory, pass the directory to the function as an argument, e.g.\np2c.curate_folder(\'C:/Users/kfrog/literature\')\nThe files will then be analyzed internally before a list of words and phrases suspected to be known chemicals is sent to NIH\'s servers to be resolved.  Chemicals found and their SMILES strings will be aggregated in a csv file for each pdf.\nAfter each pdf is processed, the data from each csv file will be combined to an aggregated csv file for all the papers in that run.\n\n- Please note: this program depends on both stable internet access and uptime/responsiveness at NIH\'s servers.  The latter are often slower or down entirely on the weekends, and sometimes this is seen during the week as well.  We appreciate the team there making the databases as accessible as they do.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe official documentation is hosted on Read the Docs: https://pdf2chem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n## Contributors\n\nWe welcome and recognize all contributions.
