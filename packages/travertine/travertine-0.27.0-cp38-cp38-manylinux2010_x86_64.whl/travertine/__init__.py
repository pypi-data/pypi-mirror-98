    This function follows a topological sort of the procedure graph so that it
    complies with the API of `Program`:class:.

    The `capacity` should be a close estimate of the number of procedures in
    the program.  You should strive to produce a number as low as possible to
    avoid consuming too much memory.  If unsure leave it as None.

    If `base_program` is not None, extend it without creating a new one.  This
    is useful in combination with `ProgramPseudoProcedure`:class:.  If this
    case, `capacity` is ignored.

    .. warning:: We don't make a copy of the `base_program`, so it gets
       modified.

    """Wraps a program as if it were a procedure.

    This class allows to extend programs in stages.  You can build and store a
    cache of base programs and later wrap them to introduce modifiers.

    Example:

       .. code-block:: python

          from travertine import create_program, ProgramPseudoProcedure
          from travertine.procedures import ConstantProcedure, FormulaProcedure
          from travertine.topo import topological_sort

          base_procedure = ConstantProcedure(10)  # Just imagine this is a big graph of procedures
          program = create_program(base_procedure)

          # Now you'd like to apply a modifying formula over the base
          # procedure but don't like to perform the entire suff.
          ref = ProgramPseudoProcedure(program)
          proc = FormulaProcedure(ref, code="#1 + 100")

          new_program = create_program(proc, base_program=program.clone())

    Instances of this class are not complete procedures: they fail to compute
    the AVM, to be callable and other requirements of `procedures
    <Procedure>`:class:.  They are only useful to create pseudo-procedures
    only meant to be translated to `travertine.Program`:class:.

    .. warning:: You can't mix several programs together using this class.

       That could lead to both unexpected results -- the program behaving
       unpredictably: segfaulting, running without halting, and in the best of
       cases `create_program` would raise ValueError.

    You SHOULD pass the original `base_procedure`, or you MUST ensure it stays
    alive for as long as the `program` is also alive.  Otherwise, Python may
    reclaim the procedure's memory and the indexes in the program would be up
    to being reused.  So adding more procedures to the program could lead to
    ValueError.
