  description: |
    Analysis of samples processed for high resolution mapping of DNA binding sites using
    targeted nuclease strategy. The process is named CUT&RUN which stands for
    Cleavage Under Target and Release Using Nuclease. Workflow includes steps of
    trimming the reads with trimgalore, aligning them using bowtie2 to target species
    genome as well as a spike-in genome. Aligned reads are processed to produce
    bigwig files to be viewed in a genome browser. Peaks are called using MACS2.
    Fragmenting of reads is performed using alignmentSieve from
    deeptools package.

            This specifies the format of input files. For paired-end data the format
            dicates how MACS2 will treat mates. If the selected format is BAM, MACS2
            will only keep the left mate  (5' end) tag. However, when format BAMPE is
            selected, MACS2 will use actual insert sizes of pairs of reads to build
            fragment pileup, instead of building bimodal distribution plus and minus
            strand reads to predict fragment size.

            It controls the MACS behavior towards duplicate tags at the exact same
            location -- the same coordination and the same strand. The 'auto' option
            makes MACS calculate the maximum tags at the exact same location based on
            binomal distribution using 1e-5 as pvalue cutoff and the 'all' option
            keeps all the tags. If an integer is given, at most this number of tags
            will be kept at the same location. The default is to keep one tag at the
            same location.
