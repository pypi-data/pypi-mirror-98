    This ATAC-seq pipeline closely follows the official ENCODE DCC pipeline. It is comprised of
    three steps; alignment, pre-peakcall QC, and calling peaks (with post-peakcall QC).

    First, reads are aligned to a genome using
    [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) aligner. Next, pre-peakcall QC
    metrics are calculated. QC report contains ENCODE 3 proposed QC metrics --
    [NRF](https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/),
    [PBC bottlenecking coefficients, NSC, and RSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/qualityMetrics.html#chipSeq).
    Finally, the peaks are called using [MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/).
    The post-peakcall QC report includes additional QC metrics -- number of peaks,
    fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP), number of reads in peaks, and if promoter
    regions BED file is provided, number of reads in promoter regions, fraction of
    reads in promoter regions, number of peaks in promoter regions, and fraction of reads in promoter regions.

            End to end: Bowtie 2 requires that the entire read align from one end to the other,
            without any trimming (or "soft clipping") of characters from either end.
            Local: Bowtie 2 does not require that the entire read align from one end to the other.
            Rather, some characters may be omitted ("soft clipped") from the ends in order to
            achieve the greatest possible alignment score.

            this parameter can be set as 200. This option is only valid when --nomodel is set or

            cutting ends (5') then apply --extsize from 5' to 3' direction to extend them to
            fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be moved toward 3'->5' direction,
            otherwise 5'->3' direction. Recommended to keep it as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets,
            or -1 * half of EXTSIZE together with --extsize option for detecting enriched cutting
            loci such as certain DNAseI-Seq datasets. Note, you can't set values other than 0 if

            MACS will now reanalyze the shape of signal profile (p or q-score depending on cutoff
            setting) to deconvolve subpeaks within each peak called from general procedure. It's
            highly recommended to detect adjacent binding events. While used, the output subpeaks
            of a big peak region will have the same peak boundaries, and different scores and peak
            summit positions.

            When this flag is on, MACS will try to composite broad regions in BED12 (a
            gene-model-like format) by putting nearby highly enriched regions into a broad region
            with loose cutoff. The broad region is controlled by another cutoff through
            --broad-cutoff. The maximum length of broad region length is 4 times of d from MACS.

            Cutoff for broad region. This option is not available unless --broad is set. If -p is
            set, this is a p-value cutoff, otherwise, it's a q-value cutoff. DEFAULT = 0.1
