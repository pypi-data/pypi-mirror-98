  description: |
    This WGBS pipeline is comprised of trimming, alignment, computation of
    methylation levels, identification of hypo-methylated regions (HMRs) and
    additional QC steps.

    First, reads are trimmed to remove adapters or kit specific artifacts.
    Reads are then aligned by __WALT__ aligner. [WALT (Wildcard ALignment
    Tool)](https://github.com/smithlabcode/walt) is fast and accurate read
    mapping for bisulfite sequencing. Then, methylation level at each genomic
    cytosine is calculated using __methcounts__. Finally, hypo-methylated
    regions are identified using __hmr__. Both methcounts and hmr are part of
    [MethPipe](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/methpipe/) package.

    QC steps are based on [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)
    and include high level metrics about the alignment, WGS performance and
    summary statistics from bisulfite sequencing. Final QC reports are
    summarized by MultiQC.

    This WGBS pipeline is comprised of trimming, alignment, computation of
    methylation levels, identification of hypo-methylated regions (HMRs) and
    additional QC steps.

    First, reads are trimmed to remove adapters or kit specific artifacts.
    Reads are then aligned by __WALT__ aligner. [WALT (Wildcard ALignment
    Tool)](https://github.com/smithlabcode/walt) is fast and accurate read
    mapping for bisulfite sequencing. Then, methylation level at each genomic
    cytosine is calculated using __methcounts__. Finally, hypo-methylated
    regions are identified using __hmr__. Both methcounts and hmr are part of
    [MethPipe](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/methpipe/) package.

    QC steps are based on [Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)
    and include high level metrics about the alignment, WGS performance and
    summary statistics from bisulfite sequencing. Final QC reports are
    summarized by MultiQC.

            In addition to the alignment score, palindrome mode can
            verify that a minimum length of adapter has been detected.
            If unspecified, this defaults to 8 bases, for historical
            reasons. However, since palindrome mode has a very low false
            positive rate, this can be safely reduced, even down to 1,
            to allow shorter adapter fragments to be removed.

            After read-though has been detected by palindrome mode, and
            the adapter sequence removed, the reverse read contains the
            same sequence information as the forward read, albeit in
            reverse complement. For this reason, the default behaviour
            is to entirely drop the reverse read. By specifying this
            parameter, the reverse read will also be retained, which may
            be useful e.g. if the downstream tools cannot handle a
            combination of paired and unpaired reads. This field is
