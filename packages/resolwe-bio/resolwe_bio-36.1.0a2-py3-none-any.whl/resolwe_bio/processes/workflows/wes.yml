    Whole exome sequencing pipeline analyzes Illumina panel data. It consists of trimming, aligning, soft clipping,
    (optional) marking of duplicates, recalibration of base quality scores and finally, calling of variants.

    The tools used are Trimmomatic which performs trimming. Aligning is performed using BWA (mem). Soft clipping of
    Illumina primer sequences is done using bamclipper tool. Marking of duplicates (MarkDuplicates), recalibration of
    base quality scores (ApplyBQSR) and calling of variants (HaplotypeCaller) is done using GATK4 bundle of
    bioinformatics tools.

    To successfully run this pipeline, you will need a genome (FASTA), paired-end (FASTQ) files, BEDPE file for
    bamclipper, known sites of variation (dbSNP) (VCF), dbSNP database of variations (can be the same as known sites of
    variation), intervals on which target capture was done (BED) and illumina adapter sequences (FASTA). Make sure that
    specified resources match the genome used in the alignment step.

    Result is a file of called variants (VCF).

                In addition to the alignment score, palindrome mode can verify that a minimum length of adapter has been
                detected. If unspecified, this defaults to 8 bases, for historical reasons. However, since palindrome mode
                has a very low false positive rate, this can be safely reduced, even down to 1, to allow shorter adapter
                fragments to be removed. This field is optional for preforming Illuminaclip. 'Adapter sequences', 'Seed mismatches',
                'Simple clip threshold' and 'Palindrome clip threshold' are also needed in order to use this parameter.
