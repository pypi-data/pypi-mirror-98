  description: |
    This RNA-seq pipeline is comprised of three steps, preprocessing,
    alignment, and quantification.

    First, reads are preprocessed by __cutadapt__ which finds and removes
    adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails and other types of unwanted
    sequence from high-throughput sequencing reads. Next, preprocessed reads
    are aligned by __STAR__ aligner. At the time of implementation, STAR is
    considered a state-of-the-art tool that consistently produces accurate
    results from diverse sets of reads, and performs well even with default
    settings. For more information see [this comparison of RNA-seq
    aligners](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5792058/).
    Finally, aligned reads are summarized to genes by __HTSeq-count__.
    Compared to featureCounts, HTSeq-count is not as computationally efficient.
    All three tools in this workflow support parallelization to accelerate
    the analysis.

      description: |
        In strand non-specific assay a read is considered overlapping with a
        feature regardless of whether it is mapped to the same or the opposite
        strand as the feature. In strand-specific forward assay and single
        reads, the read has to be mapped to the same strand as the feature.
        For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same strand and
        the second read on the opposite strand. In strand-specific reverse
        assay these rules are reversed.

              To switch on detection of chimeric (fusion) alignments (in addition to normal mapping), --chimSegmentMin should be set to a positive value. Each chimeric alignment consists of two "segments". Each segment is non-chimeric on its own, but the segments are chimeric to each other (i.e. the segments belong to different chromosomes, or different strands, or are far from each other). Both segments may contain splice junctions, and one of the segments may contain portions of both mates. --chimSegmentMin parameter controls the minimum mapped length of the two segments that is allowed. For example, if you have 2x75 reads and used --chimSegmentMin 20, a chimeric alignment with 130b on one chromosome and 20b on the other will be output, while 135 + 15 won't be.
