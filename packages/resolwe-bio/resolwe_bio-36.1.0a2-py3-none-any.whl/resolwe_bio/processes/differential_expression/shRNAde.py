    Performing differential expression on a list of objects.

    Analysis starts by inputting a set of expression files (count matrices) and a parameter file. Parameter file is
    an xlsx file and consists of tabs:
        - `sample_key`: Should have column sample with exact sample name as input expression file(s),
        columns defining treatment and lastly a column which indicates replicate.
        - `contrasts`: Define groups which will be used to perform differential expression analysis. Model for DE
        uses these contrasts and replicate number. In R annotation, this would be ` ~ 1 + group + replicate`. Table
        should have two columns named `group_1` and `group_2`.
        - `overall_contrasts`: This is a layer "above" `contrasts`, where results from two contrasts are compared for
        lethal, beneficial and neutral species. Thresholds governing classification can be found in
        `classification_parameters` tab.
        - `classification_parameters`: This tab holds three columns, `threshold`, `value` and `description`. Only
        the first two are used in the workflow, description is for your benefit.

    This process outputs DESeq2 results, classified results based on provided thresholds and counts of beneficial
    and lethal species.
