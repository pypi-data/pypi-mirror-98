Homo sapiens	NCBI	gene	protein-coding	5989	RFX1	regulatory factor X1	This gene encodes a member of the regulatory factor X (RFX) family of transcription factors, which are characterized by a winged-helix DNA-binding domain. The encoded transcription factor contains an N-terminal activation domain and a C-terminal repression domain, and may activate or repress target gene expression depending on cellular context. This transcription factor has been shown to regulate a wide variety of genes involved in immunity and cancer, including the MHC class II genes and genes that may be involved in cancer progression. This gene exhibits altered expression in glioblastoma and the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE). [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2016]	EFC,RFX
