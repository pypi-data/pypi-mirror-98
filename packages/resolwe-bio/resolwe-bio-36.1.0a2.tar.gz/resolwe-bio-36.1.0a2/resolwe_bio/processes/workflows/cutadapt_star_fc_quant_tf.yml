  description: |
    This 3' mRNA-Seq pipeline is comprised of QC, preprocessing,
    alignment and quantification steps.

    Reads are preprocessed by __Cutadapt__ which removes adapters, trims
    reads for quality from the 3'-end, and discards reads that are too
    short after trimming. Preprocessed reads are aligned by __STAR__
    aligner. For read-count quantification, the __FeatureCounts__ tool
    is used. QoRTs QC and Samtools idxstats tools are used to report
    alignment QC metrics.

    Additional QC steps operate on downsampled reads and include an
    alignment of input reads to the rRNA/globin reference sequences.
    The reported alignment rate is used to asses the rRNA/globin
    sequence depletion rate.
