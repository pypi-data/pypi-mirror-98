  description: |
    This RNA-seq pipeline is comprised of three steps, preprocessing,
    alignment, and quantification.

    First, reads are preprocessed by __Trimmomatic__ which performs a variety
    of useful trimming tasks including removing adapters for Illumina
    paired-end and single-end high-throughput sequencing reads. Next,
    preprocessed reads are aligned by __HISAT2__ aligner. HISAT2 is a fast and
    sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads
    For more information see [this comparison of RNA-seq
    aligners](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5792058/). Finally,
    aligned reads are summarized to genes by __HTSeq-count__. Compared to
    featureCounts, HTSeq-count is not as computationally efficient.  All three
    tools in this workflow support parallelization to accelerate the analysis.

      description: |
        In strand non-specific assay a read is considered overlapping with a
        feature regardless of whether it is mapped to the same or the opposite
        strand as the feature. In strand-specific forward assay and single
        reads, the read has to be mapped to the same strand as the feature.
        For paired-end reads, the first read has to be on the same strand and
        the second read on the opposite strand. In strand-specific reverse
        assay these rules are reversed.
