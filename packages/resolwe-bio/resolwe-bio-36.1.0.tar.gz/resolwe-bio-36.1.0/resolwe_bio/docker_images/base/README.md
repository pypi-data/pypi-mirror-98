# Base Docker images

The `ubuntu-18.04` and `ubuntu-20.04` images are based on the
[`public.ecr.aws/genialis/resolwe/base:ubuntu-18.04`](https://gallery.ecr.aws/genialis/resolwe/base) and
[`public.ecr.aws/genialis/resolwe/base:ubuntu-20.04`](https://gallery.ecr.aws/genialis/resolwe/base) base
images.

These base images should be used for writing any new processes that are
considered for inclusion into Resolwe Bio.
