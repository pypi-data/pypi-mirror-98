# Cleaning options for sample names. Typically, sample names are detected
# from an input filename. If any of these strings are found, they and any
# text to their right will be discarded.
# For example - file1.fq.gz_trimmed.bam_deduplicated_fastqc.zip
# would be cleaned to 'file1'
# Two options here - fn_clean_exts will remove the defaults,
# extra_fn_clean_exts will append to the defaults
