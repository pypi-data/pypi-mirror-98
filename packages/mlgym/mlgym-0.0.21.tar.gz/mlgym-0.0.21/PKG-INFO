Description: # MLgym 
        
        a python framework for distributed machine learning model training in research.
        
        [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/le1nux/mlgym.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/le1nux/mlgym)
        
        At its core, MLgym offers functionality to run gridsearches of Pytorch models at scale split over multiple GPUs and centrally store the results using [DashifyML](https://github.com/dashifyML/dashifyML). 
        
        Futhermore, MLgym provides the following key features:
        
        * **Reproducibility** of results due to full experiment specification including dataset, preprocessing routines, model architecture, loss function, metrics and more within a single YAML config.
        * Component registry to register custom components with dependencies. For instance one can define a new preprocessing routine component. This component may depend on an iterator component, as specified in the experiment config. During runtime these components are instantiated on the fly.       
        
        **Please note, that at the moment this code should be treated as experimental and is not production ready.** 
        
        ## Install
        
        there are two options to install MLgym, the easiest way is to install it from  the pip repository:
        
        ```bash
        pip install mlgym
        ``` 
        
        For the latest version, one can directly install it from source by `cd` into the root folder and then running  
        
        ```bash
        pip install src/
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        **NOTE: This framework is still under heavy development and mainly used in research projects. It's most likely not free of bugs and interfaces can still change.**
