# What is DeepHyper?

DeepHyper is an automated machine learning ([AutoML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning)) package for deep neural networks. It comprises two components: 1) Neural architecture search is an approach for automatically searching for high-performing the deep neural network
search_space. 2) Hyperparameter search is an approach for automatically searching for high-performing hyperparameters for a given deep neural network. DeepHyper provides an infrastructure that targets experimental research in neural architecture
and hyperparameter search methods, scalability, and portability across HPC systems. It comprises three modules:
benchmarks, a collection of extensible and diverse benchmark problems;
search, a set of search algorithms for neural architecture search and hyperparameter search;
and evaluators, a common interface for evaluating hyperparameter configurations
on HPC platforms.

# Documentation

Deephyper documentation is on [ReadTheDocs](https://deephyper.readthedocs.io)

# Install instructions

From pip:
```
pip install deephyper
```

From github:
```
git clone https://github.com/deephyper/deephyper.git
cd deephyper/
pip install -e .
```

if you want to install deephyper with test and documentation packages:
```
# From Pypi
pip install 'deephyper[tests,docs]'

# From github
git clone https://github.com/deephyper/deephyper.git
cd deephyper/
pip install -e '.[tests,docs]'
```

# Directory search_space

```
benchmark/
    a set of problems for hyperparameter or neural architecture search which the user can use to compare our different search algorithms or as examples to build their own problems.
evaluator/
    a set of objects which help to run search on different systems and for different cases such as quick and light experiments or long and heavy runs.
search/
    a set of algorithms for hyperparameter and neural architecture search. You will also find a modular way to define new search algorithms and specific sub modules for hyperparameter or neural architecture search.

# Quickstart

## Hyperparameter Search (HPS)

An example command line for HPS:

```bash
deephyper hps ambs --evaluator ray --problem deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.Problem --run deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.run --n-jobs 1
```

## Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

An example command line for NAS:

```bash
deephyper nas ambs --evaluator ray --problem deephyper.benchmark.nas.polynome2Reg.Problem --n-jobs 1
```
