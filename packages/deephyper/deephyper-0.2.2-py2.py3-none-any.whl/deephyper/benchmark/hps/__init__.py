Benchmarks are here for you to test the performance of different search algorithms and to help you to reproduce our results. They can also be used to test your installation of deephyper or to discover the many parameters of a search. If you want to see all available hypeparameter search benchmark please follow this link: :ref:`available-hps-benchmarks`. If you want to see how to create and run a new hyperparameter search problem please follow this link: :ref:`tutorial-hps-deep-learning-basic`.
