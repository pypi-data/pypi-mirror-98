  - Added new parameters to Share Migration experimental API.
features:
  - Share Migration now has parameters to force share migration
    procedure to maintain the share writable, preserve its metadata
    and be non-disruptive when migrating.
  - Added parameter to change share network when performing
    migration.
deprecations:
  - Renamed Share Migration 'force_host_copy' parameter
    to 'force_host_assisted_migration', to better represent
    the parameter's functionality.
  - API version 2.22 is now required for all Share Migration APIs.
upgrades:
  - Removed Share Migration 'notify' parameter, it is no longer
    possible to perform a 1-phase migration.
  - Removed 'migrate_share' API support.
  - Added 'None' to 'reset_task_state' API possible values so it
    can unset the task_state.
