    Since the share group APIs have graduated from their `experimental feature
    state <https://docs.openstack.org/manila/latest/contributor/experimental_apis.html>`_
    in API version ``2.55``, the client was updated to fit into those changes,
    and the share group commands will no longer include the
    `X-OpenStack-Manila-API-Experimental`` header in the request. Share group
    types can be created to encompass one or more share types, share groups
    can be created, updated, snapshotted and deleted, and shares can be created
    within share groups.
