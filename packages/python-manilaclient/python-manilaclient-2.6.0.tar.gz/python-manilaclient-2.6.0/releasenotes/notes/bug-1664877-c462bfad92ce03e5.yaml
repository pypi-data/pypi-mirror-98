    If using python3.5, a TypeError will raise if server returns a 4xx
    response. Below is the error message:

    TypeError: unorderable types: int() > NoneType()

    This error occurred because python-manilaclient tried to compare
    an integer with None. This is not a valid comparison starting
    from python3.5.

    See bug #1664877 for more details.
