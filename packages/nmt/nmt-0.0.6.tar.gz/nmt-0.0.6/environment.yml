# channels are processed in order, top to bottom, higher priority channels are at the top
#   defaults: should be at the top: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html#managing-channels
#   pytorch: higher priotiry than conda-forge in case pytorch developers need to override conda-forge packages
#   conda-forge: may be required for some dependencies like editdistance not hosted in defaults or pytorch
#   anaconda: should not be used in combination with these other channels
channels:
  - defaults  # should be at the top of the list: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html#managing-channel
  - pytorch
  - conda-forge  # conda-forge is higher priority than defaults in nlpia package
  # - anaconda  # bad idea: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9462
