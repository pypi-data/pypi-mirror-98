Description: setuptools extension for building non-python shared libraries
        and packaging them for distribution.  eg. for use by python extensions.
        
        This extension provides at alternative to bundling externally built
        libraries in Python Wheel packages.  This is to replace the external
        build system (eg. Makefile).
        
        If you have to ask "why", then keep moving along.  There is nothing for you to see here.
