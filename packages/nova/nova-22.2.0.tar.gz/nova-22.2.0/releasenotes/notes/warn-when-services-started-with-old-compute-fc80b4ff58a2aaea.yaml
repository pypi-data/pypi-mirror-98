    Nova services only support old computes if the compute is not
    older than the previous major nova release. From now on nova services will
    emit a warning at startup if the deployment contains too old compute
    services. From the 23.0.0 (Wallaby) release nova services will refuse to
    start if the deployment contains too old compute services to prevent
    compatibility issues.
