    The support for guest RAM encryption using AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted
    Virtualization) added in Train is incompatible with a number of image
    metadata options:

    - ``hw_scsi_model=virtio-scsi`` and either ``hw_disk_bus=scsi`` or
      ``hw_cdrom_bus=scsi``
    - ``hw_video_model=virtio``
    - ``hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes``

    When used together, the guest kernel can malfunction with repeated warnings
    like::

        NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [system-udevd:272]

    This will be resolved in a future patch release. For more information,
    refer to `bug 1845986`__
