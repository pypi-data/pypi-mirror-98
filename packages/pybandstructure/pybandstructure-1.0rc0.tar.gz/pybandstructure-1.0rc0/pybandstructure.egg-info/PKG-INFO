Description: # Pybandstructure
        
        Band structure calculator for simple models.
        Allows easy implementation of simple periodic Hamiltonians including tight binding or plane waves models.
        Results can be analyzed to extract thermodynamical properties, density of states, and optical conductivity.
        A submodule is devoted to the implementation of superlattice hamiltonians.
