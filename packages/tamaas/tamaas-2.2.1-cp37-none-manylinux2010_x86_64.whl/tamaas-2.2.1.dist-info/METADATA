Tamaas (from تماس meaning “contact” in Arabic and Farsi) is a
high-performance rough-surface periodic contact code based on boundary and
volume integral equations. The clever mathematical formulation of the underlying
numerical methods allows the use of the fast-Fourier Transform, a great help in
achieving peak performance: Tamaas is consistently two orders of magnitude
faster (and lighter) than traditional FEM! Tamaas is aimed at researchers and
practitioners wishing to compute realistic contact solutions for the study of
interface phenomena.

## Disclaimer

This package is intended for ease of installation for Linux platforms, but comes
with NO WARRANTY of compatibility (although it is manylinux2010_x86_64
compliant). If you experience any issue, please install Tamaas from
[source](https://c4science.ch/source/tamaas/). We provide a Docker image for
non-Linux systems. Note that to satisfy the manylinux2010 requirements, the
version of Tamaas provided by this package is not parallel.

This version of Tamaas is statically linked to [FFTW3](http://fftw.org/)
developed by Matteo Frigo and Steven G. Johnson, released under the terms of the
GPL public license ([source code](https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3)).

Tamaas is the result of a science research project. To give proper credit to
Tamaas and the researchers who have developed the numerical methods that it
implements, please cite the [JOSS
paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/86903c51f3c66964eef7776d8aeaf17d) and the
appropriate references therein.

## Dependencies

Essentials:

- Numpy

Optional:

- Scipy (for non-linear solvers)
- UVW (for dumpers)
- h5py (for dumpers)
- netCDF4 (for dumpers)

To install with all dependencies, run ``pip install
tamaas[solvers,dumpers]``.
