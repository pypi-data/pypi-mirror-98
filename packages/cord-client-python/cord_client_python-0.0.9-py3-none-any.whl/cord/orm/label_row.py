class LabelRow(base_orm.BaseORM):
    """
    A label row contains a data unit or a collection of data units and associated labels,
    and is specific to a data asset with type video or img_group:

        - A label row with a data asset of type video contains a single data unit.
        - A label row with a data asset of type img_group contains any number of data units.

    Label row ORM:

    label_hash (uid),
    data_title,
    data_type,
    data_units,
    object_answers,
    classification_answers,
    label_status

    A data unit, contained the dictionary data_units, is in the form:

        "data_units": {
            "data_hash": {
                "data_hash": A data_hash (uid) string
                "data_title": A data title string
                "data_link": Signed URL expiring after 7 days,
                "data_type": Data unit type (video/mp4, image/jpeg, etc.)
                "data_fps": For video, the frame rate
                "data_sequence": Sequence number of data unit in label row.
                "labels": {
                    ...
                }
            },
            ...,
        }

    A data unit can have any number of vector labels (e.g. bounding box, polygon, keypoint) and classifications.

    Each frame-level object and classification has unique identifiers 'objectHash' and 'classificationHash'.
    Each frame-level entity has a unique feature identifier 'featureHash', defined in the editor ontology.

    The object and classification answers are contained separately from the individual data units to
    preserve space for video, sequential images, DICOM, etc.

    The objects and classifications answer dictionaries contain classification 'answers' (i.e. attributes
    that describe the object or classification). This is to avoid storing the information at every frame
    in the blurb, of particular importance for videos.

    A labels dictionary for video is in the form:
    {
        "frame": {
            "objects": {
                [{object 1}, {object 2}, ...]
            }
            "classifications": {
                [{classification 1}, {classification 2}, ...]
            }
        }
    }

    A labels dictionary for an img_group data unit is in the form:
    {
        "objects": {
            [{object 1}, {object 2}, ...]
        }
        "classifications": {
            [{classification 1}, {classification 2}, ...]
        }
    }

    The object answers dictionary is in the form:
    {
        "objectHash": {
            "objectHash": objectHash,
            "classifications": [{answer 1}, {answer 2}, ...]
        },
        ...
    }

    The classification answers dictionary is in the form:
    {
        "classificationHash": {
            "classificationHash": classificationHash,
            "classifications": [{answer 1}, {answer 2}, ...]
        },
        ...
    }
