        ## 💡 Getting Started
        
        For full documentation, visit [Cord Python API Client](https://docs.cord.tech/docs/client/).
        
        First, install Cord Python API Client using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing) package manager:
        
        ```bash
        pip install cord-client-python
        ```
        
        Then, create an API key for authentication via the [Cord web app](https://app.cord.tech). Pass the project ID and API key as environment variables or pass them explicitly when you initialise the CordClient object.
        
        ```bash
        export CORD_PROJECT_ID="<project_id>"
        export CORD_API_KEY="<project_api_key>"
        ```
        
        Passing the project ID and API key as environment variables, you can initialise the Cord client directly.
        
        ```python
        from cord.client import CordClient
        
        client = CordClient.initialise()
        ```
        
        If you want to avoid setting environment variables, you can initialise the Cord client by passing the project ID and API key as strings.
        
        ```python
        from cord.client import CordClient
        
        client = CordClient.initialise("<project_id>", "<project_api_key>")
        ```
        
        If you wish to instantiate several client objects and avoid passing parameters each time, you can instantiate a CordConfig object, pass the project ID and API key as strings, and initialise the client with the config object.
        
        ```py
        from cord.client import CordClient
        from cord.client import CordConfig
        
        config = CordConfig("<project_id>", "<project_api_key>")
        client = CordClient.initialise_with_config(config)
        ```
        
        Once you have instantiated a Cord client, it is easy to fetch information associated with the given project ID.
        
        ```py
        from cord.client import CordClient
        
        client = CordClient.initialise()
        project = client.get_project()
        ```
