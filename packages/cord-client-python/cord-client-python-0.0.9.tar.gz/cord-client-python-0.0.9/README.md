## üí° Getting Started

For full documentation, visit [Cord Python API Client](https://docs.cord.tech/docs/client/).

First, install Cord Python API Client using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing) package manager:

```bash
pip install cord-client-python
```

Then, create an API key for authentication via the [Cord web app](https://app.cord.tech). Pass the project ID and API key as environment variables or pass them explicitly when you initialise the CordClient object.

```bash
export CORD_PROJECT_ID="<project_id>"
export CORD_API_KEY="<project_api_key>"
```

Passing the project ID and API key as environment variables, you can initialise the Cord client directly.

```python
from cord.client import CordClient

client = CordClient.initialise()
```

If you want to avoid setting environment variables, you can initialise the Cord client by passing the project ID and API key as strings.

```python
from cord.client import CordClient

client = CordClient.initialise("<project_id>", "<project_api_key>")
```

If you wish to instantiate several client objects and avoid passing parameters each time, you can instantiate a CordConfig object, pass the project ID and API key as strings, and initialise the client with the config object.

```py
from cord.client import CordClient
from cord.client import CordConfig

config = CordConfig("<project_id>", "<project_api_key>")
client = CordClient.initialise_with_config(config)
```

Once you have instantiated a Cord client, it is easy to fetch information associated with the given project ID.

```py
from cord.client import CordClient

client = CordClient.initialise()
project = client.get_project()
```
