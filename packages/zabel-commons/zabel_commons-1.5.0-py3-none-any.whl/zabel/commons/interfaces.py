                              to being an #BaseService and those

class BaseService(Image):

    Provides a minimal set of features a service must provide.

    - accessors for name and platform

    _BaseService_ instances are expected to expose some entrypoints and
    make them available through a web server.

    This class provides a default implementation of such a server and
    exposes the defined entrypoints.

    Its `run()` that takes any number of string arguments.  It starts a
    web server on the host and port provided via `--host` and `--port`
    arguments, or, if not specified, via the `host` and `port` instance
    attributes, or `localhost` on port 8080 if none of the above are
    available:

    ```python
    # Explicit host and port
    foo.run('--host', '0.0.0.0', '--port', '80')

    # Explicit host, default port (8080)
    foo.run('--host', '192.168.12.34')

    # Host specified for the object, default port (8080)
    foo.host = '10.0.0.1'
    foo.run()

    # Default host and port (localhost:8080)
    foo.run()
    ```

    The exposed entrypoints are those defined on all instance members.
    The entrypoint definitions are inherited (i.e., you don't have to
    redefine them if they are already defined).

    ```python
    class Foo(BasicService):
        @entrypoint('/foo/bar')
        def get_bar():
            ...

    class FooBar(Foo):
        def get_bar():
            return 'foobar.get_bar'

    FooBar().run()  # curl localhost:8080/foo/bar -> foobar.get_bar
    ```

    **Note**: You can redefine the entrypoint attached to a method.
    Simply add a new `@entrypoint` decorator to the method.  And, if
    you want to disable the entrypoint, use `[]` as the path.

    **Note**: The web server is implemented using Bottle.  If you prefer
    or need to use another wsgi server, simple override the `run()`
    method in your class.  Your class will then have no dependency on
    Bottle.

                      (a dictionary).      | Yes (read/write)        |
    | `name`        | The service name.    | Yes (read/write)        |

    Unimplemented features will raise a _NotImplementedError_ exception.

    Some features provide default implementation, but those default
    implementations may not be very efficient.
