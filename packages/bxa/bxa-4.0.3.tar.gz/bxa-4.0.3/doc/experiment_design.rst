Experiment design
------------------

We want to to evaluate whether a planned experiment can detect features or constrain parameters, 
i.e. determine the discriminatory power of future configurations/surveys/missions.

For this, simulate a few spectra using the appropriate response.

* Case 1: Can the experiment constrain the parameters?
	* Analyse and check what fraction of the posterior samples lie inside/outside the region of interest.
* Case 2: Can the experiment distinguish between two models?
	* Model selection as above.
* Case 3: Which sources (redshift range, luminosity, etc) can be distinguished?
	* Compute a grid of spectra. Do model selection at each point in the grid.
