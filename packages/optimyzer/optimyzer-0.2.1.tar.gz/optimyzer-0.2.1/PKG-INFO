        A hyperparameter optimization framework that fits into every workflow
        
        > This project is still in _beta_ stage. This means that interfaces might change
        more often than expected. If you have any kind of issue or suggestion, please

        ## Introduction
        
        While creating machine learning models is fun, optimizing their hyperparameters usually isn't. Many
        people do this manually, which is often ironically referred to as _expert descent_.
        
        Coming more from the world of numerical optimization, many available hyperparameter optimization
        frameworks see the problem as a function optimization problem. However, this means that the code of
        the project has to be structured in a way that the entire machine-learning pipeline (loading data,
        preprocessing, training, evaluating) is one function call. Furthermore, all parameters have to be
        available as function arguments. For many projects, wrapping the entire machine learning pipeline
        into a function call is cumbersome and a waste of time.
        
        `Optimyzer` provides a framework to make hyperparameter optimization easy. It features a very simple
        interface, such that the optimization can be done with just a few lines of code, and in any existing
        workflow. It logs all relevant data into a file-based structure, where each experiment gets its own
        folder. At the moment `Optimyzer` only uses random search because it is easy to use, highly
        parallelizable and already way better than _expert descent_ or _grid search_.
        
        If you find a bug, or have an improvement suggestion or feature request, you can directly add it
        into our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gauss-ml-open/optimyzer-client/-/issues). If you have
        general remarks, feedback or other comments, please don't hesitate to contact us at
        [info@gauss-ml.com](mailto:info@gauss-ml.com).
        
        ### Example Use-case
        
        Let's say you want to do handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset with a simple multilayer
        perceptron (MLP). Already with such a setup there are a couple of parameters to tune: The depth
        (number of layers) and width (units per layer) of the MLP, as well as the learning rate of the
        optimization algorithm, batch size and so on. Usually there are many more. Getting those
        hyperparameters right can make the difference between mediocre and world-class performance.
        
        Sure, you can _quickly_ try out what happens when you change one of the parameters. And then tweak
        another parameter. A couple of hours later, _just one more tweak and the performance will be good
        enough._ We have been there. We didn't like it. With `Optimyzer`, we would like to help people to
        avoid wasting their time with parameter tuning.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Starting to use `Optimyzer` is really simple, as you will see from the [Installation](#installation)
        and [Usage](#usage-of-the-optimyzer) sections. Additionally, we will explain how the `Optimyzer`'s
        [information flow](#the-information-flow) differs from most other optimizers and how `Optimyzer`
        stores the necessary data.
        
        ### Installation
        
        Installing `Optimyzer` is very easy, just run `pip install optimyzer` in your favorite Python
        environment and you're done. If you like it, you might want to add `Optimyzer` to your project's
        dependencies.
        
        By the way, `Optimyzer` does not have any dependency, it is powered by the Python Standard Library
        only. Also, there is no database, no inter-process communication, nothing to install, nothing to
        configure, nothing to take care of.
        
        ### Optimyzer Usage
        
        `Optimyzer` has been built to be included in any kind of workflow as easily as possible. This is
        the minimal version:
        
        First we have to import it (of course):
        
        ```python
        import optimyzer
        ```
        
        Then we instantiate the `Optimyzer` object and select a directory where it runs:
        
        ```python
        oy = optimyzer.Optimyzer(".")  # initializes an Optimyzer in the current workdir
        ```
        
        For each parameter we want to tune, we have to tell `Optimyzer` the type and
        range. This is done by adding a parameter (`IntParameter`, `FloatParameter` or
        `CategoricalParameter`) to `Optimyzer`:
        
        ```python
        oy.add_parameter(optimyzer.IntParameter("int_name", (minimum, maximum)))
        oy.add_parameter(optimyzer.FloatParameter("float_name", (minimum, maximum)))
        oy.add_parameter(optimyzer.CategoricalParameter("cat_name", ["a", "b", "c"]))
        ```
        
        Note that the parameters can be freely named, except for the metadata names `workdir`, `id` and
        `value`.
        
        Once we have added the parameters, we can sample from the parameter space:
        
        ```python
        config = oy.create_config()  # create a configuration by random sampling
        ```
        
        This returns a configuration that holds all your parameters as properties, e.g., `config.int_name`
        or `config.float_name`. For convenience, this configuration also contains the `id` and `workdir` of
        the instance. Note that you cannot add or change your parameters after creating a configuration.
        
        Now you can run the rest of your pipeline, using the sampled parameters from the `config`. After
        everything is done and you have evaluated the `performance` of your model, you report it back to
        `Optimyzer`:
        
        ```python
        oy.report_loss(performance)
        ```
        
        That's it already! With just a few extra lines of code, you can run your training pipeline using
        hyper-parameters sampled from your search space.
        
        You can now execute the optimization by running this file a couple of times, either sequentially in
        a simple loop (if you only have one GPU) or in parallel. It doesn't matter whether you're running
        this on your laptop or your GPU cluster. The only thing that you need is a shared file system where
        the base directory is located.
        
        After running this as many times as you wish, you can get the optimal configuration directly from a
        static top-level function of the package:
        
        ```python
        optimal_config = optimyzer.get_optimal_config(basedir)
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can find the optimal parameters in a human-readable JSON file located at
        (`best_instance/.optimyzer/config.json`), in the `basedir` you gave to `Optimyzer`.
        
        Note that this framework is entirely transparent; there are no secret hooks for particular
        libraries, nothing hidden happening. You're in control and know what is going on in your code.
        
        #### Parameter Types
        
        There are tree main types of parameters available:
        
        * `IntParameter` for integer-valued options, like the number of layers in a
            neural network or the number of features for a spectral method.
        * `FloatParameter` for real-valued options, like the learning rate in neural
            networks or length scales in kernel methods.
        * `CategoricalParameter` for choices, like the type of optimization algorithm
            for a neural network or the covanriance function in Gaussian processes.
        
        Since quite often numerical parameters roughly follow Zipf's law (in the sense
        that larger parameters are less likely than smaller parameters), and due to the
        fact that often the relative change in parameters during optimization is much
        more meaningful than the absolute change, it makes sense to define certain
        parameter on a log scale. This can be done by adding the keyword argument
        `logarithmic=True` when initilizing the parameter:
        
        ```python
        optimyzer.IntParameter("int_name", (minimum, maximum), logarithmic=True)
        optimyzer.FloatParameter("float_name", (minimum, maximum), logarithmic=True)
        ```
        
        Using a logarithmic distribution is helpful, for instance, when optimizing
        length scales, learning rates, noise levels, signal variances, lengths, masses,
        etc.
        
        #### Illustrative Integration in ML Code
        
        A cartoon example of a machine learning pipeline based on our imaginary neural network framework
        `neuralnetworks` is shown below. A full Keras tutorial is located in the [`notebooks`](notebooks)
        directory, both as [cell-based script](notebooks/mnist_keras.py) and as [Jupyter
        notebook](notebooks/mnist_keras.ipynb).
        
        ```python
        # import stuff
        import neuralnetworks as nn
        import optimyzer
        
        train_inputs, train_targets, test_inputs, test_targets = nn.load_preprocessed_data('MNIST')
        
        # Optimyzer: initialize and configure parameterspace
        oy = optimyzer.Optimyzer(".")  # initializes an Optimyzer in the current workdir
        
        # int between 1 and 10 for the depth (number of layers)
        oy.add_parameter(optimyzer.IntParameter("depth", (1, 10)))
        # int between 32 and 1024 for the width (nodes per layer)
        oy.add_parameter(optimyzer.IntParameter("width", (32, 1024)))
        # float between 1e-3 and 1e0 for learning_rate
        oy.add_parameter(optimyzer.FloatParameter("learning_rate", (1e-3, 1e0)))
        # two different neural network optimizers
        oy.add_parameter(optimyzer.CategoricalParameter("opt", ["SGD", "ADAM"]))
        
        # Optimyzer: freeze configuration and sample
        config = oy.create_config()  # we create a config by random sampling
        
        # create a model
        model = nn.MLP(depth=config.depth, width=config.width)  # use sampled values
        
        # select training algorithm based on sampled category
        if config.opt == "SGD":
            opt = nn.opt.SGD(model, learning_rate=config.learning_rate)
        if config.opt == "ADAM":
            opt = nn.opt.ADAM(model, learning_rate=config.learning_rate)
        
        # train the model
        model.train(opt, train_inputs, train_targets)
        
        # after the training: check how many predictions were correct
        pred = model.predict(test_inputs)
        correct = sum(pred == test_targets)
        
        # Optimyzer: report the loss
        oy.report_loss(performance)
        ```
        
        That's just four additional lines of code for using `Optimyzer`, plus one line for each parameter.
        
        ### Directory Handling
        
        Oftentimes, machine learning pipelines write data into a working directory. For example, training
        progress often is logged into a `tensorboard` directory and model checkpoints are stored as well.
        `Optimyzer` therefore provides a working directory for each configuration instance, so that logging
        and checkpoint saving can be done without risking to overwrite the data from other runs. `Optimyzer`
        itself stores the instance configuration and resulting performance within that directory in its
        `.optimyzer` folder.
        
        #### Absolute Paths
        
        If you already use absolute paths, great! If the path where you do your experiments is, for example,
        `/var/tmp/ml-experiments/`, you can give that path directly to `optimyzer` like this:
        
        ```python
        experiment_dir = "/var/tmp/ml-experiments"
        oy = optimyzer.Optimyzer(experiment_dir)
        ```
        
        When you create a configuration
        
        ```python
        config = oy.create_config()
        ```
        
        this `config` will contain a working directory `config.workdir` that you can use subsequently, for
        instance to save a model
        
        ```python
        model.save(os.path.join(config.workdir, "model.nn"))
        ```
        
        #### Relative Paths and Current Working Directory
        
        If you just have a script running that uses the current working directory (where the script is
        executed), no problem either! You can initialize `Optimyzer` in the current working directory
        as well:
        
        ```python
        oy = optimyzer.Optimyzer(".")
        ```
        
        When you create a configuration, you can pass the `chdir=True` switch:
        
        ```python
        config = oy.create_config(chdir=True)
        ```
        
        This will change the current working directory from the location of your script to the working
        directory of this instance. This means that all relative file system commands are now executed
        relative to the working directory. This means that you don't have to take care of the paths and can
        just continue using commands that operate in the current working directory, for instance
        
        ```python
        model.save("model.nn")
        ```
        
        ### Further Reading: How the Metadata is Stored
        
        While `Optimyzer` works equally fine for algorithms that never store any data, it was designed to
        work well with pipelines that need some kind of working directory to store results or configuration
        or logging information. That's why there is one directory created for each instance. The instance
        name is based on the configuration, which is hashed to generate a unique name.
        
        This means that after executing a couple of runs, your `experiments` directory may look like this
        
        ```none
        experiments
        |- 5c49826a83751767729e
        |- 71ae3a23d782a0465750
        |- 7633242a2c695641532b
        |- d0b85d53f19420d1a7a1
        |- dee9fecd1f0b91346bc4
        |- best_instance -> 71ae3a23d782a0465750
        |- ...
        ```
        
        where each directory represents one experiment instance, one configuration that has been evaluated.
        The directory `best_instance` is a symbolic link that points to the directory of the best
        configuration seen so far.
        
        Each of the experiment instances contains a metadata folder `.optimyzer`, which holds the
        configuration and the value of the experiment in a JSON file each
        
        ```none
        experiments
        |- 5c49826a83751767729e
           |- .optimyzer
               |- config.json
               |- value.json
        |- 71ae3a23d782a0465750
           |- .optimyzer
               |- config.json
               |- value.json
        |- ...
        ```
