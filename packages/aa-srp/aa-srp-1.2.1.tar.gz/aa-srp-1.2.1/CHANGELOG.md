## [1.2.1] - 2021-03-14

### Fixed

- SRP cost info bar removed from user settings tab


## [1.2.0] - 2021-03-14

### Added

- Option for users to disable notifications for this module. When enabled, no
  notifications will be sent at all. Neither in AA itself nor on Discord (if any of
  the Discord apps is active)
- Check if [AA Discord Notify](https://gitlab.com/ErikKalkoken/aa-discordnotify) is
  installed, which picks up on notifications in Auth and relays them to the
  respective user as Discord PM. This way we don't send double notifications to the
  user if [AA-Discordbot](https://github.com/pvyParts/allianceauth-discordbot) is
  installed as well.

### Changed

- Enabled paging for SRP link table on dashboard in "View All" mode


## [1.1.0] - 2021-03-02

  installed and configured to use this option)


## [1.0.1] - 2021-02-09

### Fixed

- Discord PM on approval or reject goes to the reviewer instead of the requester (#11)


## [1.0.0] - 2021-02-06

## Important Update Instructions

**IMPORTANT**

If you update from v0.1.0-beta.4 or earlier, make sure to read carefully.

In this version the way the SRP ship is handled has changed. It is no longer just a
simple string in the database, it is now a proper EveType model. So you have to do
some extra steps to migrate your data.

**This needs to be done right after you have updated AA SRP from a version prior
v0.1.0-beta.5.**

### Step 1 - Install EveUniverse

This should be done automatically with the update, but there is still a bit of
manual work to it. First you need to add the EveUniverse module to your
`INSTALLED_APPS` in your `loca.py`.

- Add `"eveuniverse",` to `INSTALLED_APPS`


### Step 2 - Static collection and migration

Now that EveUniverse is installed, you need to run the static collection and
migration. Don't forget to restart your supervisor afterwards.

```shell
python manage.py collectstatic
```

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

Restart your supervisor services for Auth

### Step 3 - Import ship information from ESI

This is where the magic happens. You are now ready to import the ship information
from ESI.

```shell
python manage.py aasrp_load_eve
```


### Step 4 - Migrate your SRP data

Now that we have all the needed information, your SRP data needs to be updated. This
is just another simple command.

```shell
python manage.py aasrp_update_db_relations
```


## [0.1.0-beta.4] - 2020-12-28

### Fixed

- Permissions on "Edit AAR Link" view some ajax requests


## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2020-12-28

- First public beta release
