Description: **Fast Json Normalize**
        
        A package designed to be a drop in replacement for the pandas json normalize function, as it can be rather slow when dealing with very large json files.
        
        It can be installed using
        
        ```
        pip install fast-json-normalize
        ```
        
        (plan on making a pull request once I've integrated it into a fork of [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
