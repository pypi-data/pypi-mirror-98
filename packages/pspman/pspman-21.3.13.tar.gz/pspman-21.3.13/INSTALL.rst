git
^^^

-  copy installation scripts from `this <https://github.com/pradyparanjpe/pspman.git>`__ repository

.. code:: sh

   wget https://github.com/pradyparanjpe/pspman/blob/master/install.sh
   wget https://github.com/pradyparanjpe/pspman/blob/master/install.py

-  Run Installation script

.. code:: sh

   bash ./install.sh install

pip
^^^

-  install using pip (Just because it is a python package)

.. code:: sh

   pip install --user -U pspman

- Create directories: ``${HOME}/.pspman``
- arrange to export PYTHONPATH and PATH, Ex. by adding to ``${HOME}/.bashrc``:

.. code:: sh

   export PYTHONPATH="${HOME}/.pspman/lib/``$python_version``/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}"
   export PATH="${HOME}/.pspman/bin:${PYTHONPATH}"

- You will have to update the ``$python_version`` every time python is updated.
