        Package ``apache-airflow-providers-apache-druid``
        
        Release: ``1.1.0``
        
        
        `Apache Druid <https://druid.apache.org/>`__.
        
        
        Provider package
        ================
        
        This is a provider package for ``apache.druid`` provider. All classes for this provider package
        are in ``airflow.providers.apache.druid`` python package.
        
        You can find package information and changelog for the provider
        in the `documentation <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-apache-druid/1.1.0/>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        NOTE!
        
        On November 2020, new version of PIP (20.3) has been released with a new, 2020 resolver. This resolver
        does not yet work with Apache Airflow and might lead to errors in installation - depends on your choice
        of extras. In order to install Airflow you need to either downgrade pip to version 20.2.4
        ``pip install --upgrade pip==20.2.4`` or, in case you use Pip 20.3, you need to add option
        ``--use-deprecated legacy-resolver`` to your pip install command.
        
        You can install this package on top of an existing airflow 2.* installation via
        ``pip install apache-airflow-providers-apache-druid``
