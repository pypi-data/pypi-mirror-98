        **Evapotranspiration (ET) models for use in python and with integration into Google Earth Engine.**
        
        geeet aims to provide users with ready-to-use evapotranspiration (ET) models, both for numerical values and for use with Google Earth Engine. 
        
        This initial release features a PT-JPL model adapted for arid environments (as described in Aragon et al., 2018). A notebook example is included in `./examples/notebooks/01_PTJPL.ipynb`.

        ## Features
        
        - PT-JPL model for arid environments (as described in Aragon et al., 2018)    
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install geeet`
        
        A release will soon be uploaded to conda-forge. 
        
        ## References
        
        References for each model are found in [REFERENCES.txt](REFERENCES.txt). The source code for each module contains references for each function as well. Finally, each model contains two functions to display the references: `cite()` shows the main citation for the model, while `cite_all()` shows all the references for that model.
        
        If you use this package for research, please cite the relevant model. 
        
        ## Contributions
        
        Contributions are welcome. We aim to include as many ET models to allow researchers to intercompare the different models.
