# History

## 0.4.0 - 2021-02-24

In this release a change in the HyperTransformer allows using it to transform and
reverse transform a subset of the columns seen during training.

The anonymization functionality which was deprecated and not being used has also
been removed along with the Faker dependency.

### Issues closed

* Allow the HyperTransformer to be used on a subset of the columns - Issue [#152](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/152) by @csala
* Remove faker - Issue [#150](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/150) by @csala

## 0.3.0 - 2021-01-27

This release changes the behavior of the `HyperTransformer` to prevent it from
modifying any column in the given `DataFrame` if the `transformers` dictionary
is passed empty.

### Issues closed

* If transformers is an empty dict, do nothing - Issue [#149](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/149) by @csala

## 0.2.10 - 2020-12-18

This release adds a new argument to the `HyperTransformer` which gives control over
which transformers to use by default for each `dtype` if no specific transformer
has been specified for the field.

This is also the first version to be officially released on conda.

### Issues closed

* Add `dtype_transformers` argument to HyperTransformer - Issue [#148](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/148) by @csala
* Makes Copulas an optional dependency - Issue [#144](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/144) by @fealho

## 0.2.9 - 2020-11-27

This release fixes a bug that prevented the `CategoricalTransformer` from working properly
when being passed data that contained numerical data only, without any strings, but also
contained `None` or `NaN` values.

### Issues closed

* KeyError: nan - CategoricalTransformer fails on numerical + nan data only - Issue [#142](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/142) by @csala

## 0.2.8 - 2020-11-20

This release fixes a few minor bugs, including some which prevented RDT from fully working
on Windows systems.

Thanks to this fixes, as well as a new testing infrastructure that has been set up, from now
on RDT is officially supported on Windows systems, as well as on the Linux and macOS systems
which were previously supported.

### Issues closed

* TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for: 'NoneType' and 'int' - Issue [#132](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/132) by @csala
* Example does not work on Windows - Issue [#114](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/114) by @csala

* OneHotEncodingTransformer support for lists and lists of lists - Issue [#137](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/137) by @fealho

## 0.2.7 - 2020-10-16

In this release we drop the support for the now officially dead Python 3.5
and introduce a new feature in the DatetimeTransformer which reduces the dimensionality
of the generated numerical values while also ensuring that the reverted datetimes
maintain the same level as time unit precision as the original ones.

* Drop Py35 support - Issue [#129](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/129) by @csala
* Add option to drop constant parts of the datetimes - Issue [#130](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/130) by @csala

## 0.2.6 - 2020-10-05

* Add GaussianCopulaTransformer - Issue [#125](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/125) by @csala
* dtype category error - Issue [#124](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/124) by @csala

## 0.2.5 - 2020-09-18

### Bugs Fixed

* Boolean Transformer fails to revert when there are NO nulls - Issue [#103](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT/issues/103) by @JDTheRipperPC

## 0.2.0 - 2019-10-15

This version comes with a brand new API and internal implementation, removing the old
metadata JSON from the user provided arguments, and making each transformer work only
with `pandas.Series` of their corresponding data type.

As part of this change, several transformer names have been changed and a new BooleanTransformer
and a feature to automatically decide which transformers to use based on dtypes have been added.

Unit test coverage has also been increased to 100%.

Special thanks to @JDTheRipperPC and @csala for the big efforts put in making this
release possible.
