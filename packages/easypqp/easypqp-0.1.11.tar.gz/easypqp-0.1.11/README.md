EasyPQP: Simple library generation for OpenSWATH
================================================

EasyPQP is a Python package that provides simplified and fast peptide query parameter generation for OpenSWATH. It can process input from MSFragger or other database search engines in pepXML format. Statistical validation can be conducted either using PyProphet or PeptideProphet/iProphet. Retention times are calibrated using an internal or external standard. In addition to a cumulative library, run-specific libraries are generated for non-linear RT alignment in OpenSWATH.
