    Perlin Noise
    ============
    Perlin Noise n-dimensional gradient noise functions.
     * Perlin Noise noise object for python ``3.9`` and more recent versions
     * support for any dimensional evaluation
     * to be used with Phoenyx

    Callable that produces Perlin noise for an arbitrary point in an
    arbitrary number of dimensions.  The underlying grid is aligned with the
    integers.

    There is no limit to the coordinates used, new gradients are generated on
    the fly as necessary.
    """
    def __init__(self, dimension: int, octaves: int = 1, tile: tuple[int] = (), unbias: bool = False) -> None:
        """
        Create a new Perlin noise factory in the given number of dimensions,
        which should be an integer and at least 1.

        More octaves create a foggier and more-detailed noise pattern. More
        than 4 octaves is rather excessive.

        ``tile`` can be used to make a seamlessly tiling pattern. For example:

            noise = PerlinNoise(2, tile=(0, 3))

        This will produce noise that tiles every 3 units vertically, but never
        tiles horizontally.

        If ``unbias`` is true, the quintic function will be applied to the
        output before returning it, to counteract some of Perlin noise's
        significant bias towards the center of its output range.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
            dimension : int
                number of dimension, should be at least 1
            octaves : (int, optionnal)
                number of octaves, determines the fogginess of the noise pattern
                should be greater than 1 and less than the recommended 4
                Defaults to 1
            tile : (tuple[int], optionnal)
                tiles the noise pattern along each axis
                should be same dimension as first parameter
                Defaults to ()
            unbias : (bool, optionnal)
                apply quintic function before output
                depending on rather or not you rely on frames, you might want to set this to True
                Defaults to False
