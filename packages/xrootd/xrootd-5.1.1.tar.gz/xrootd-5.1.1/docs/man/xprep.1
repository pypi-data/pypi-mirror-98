.RE
\fB-S\fR
.RS 5
requests that the file be copied into the cluster should it not be found
on the same server as the first file in the specified list of files
When the file is copied it is co-located with the first

Unless the \fB-s\fR or \fB-S\fR option is specified, file preparation merely
seeds the redirector's location cache. This allows the look-ups for prepared
files to progress much faster in the future.
