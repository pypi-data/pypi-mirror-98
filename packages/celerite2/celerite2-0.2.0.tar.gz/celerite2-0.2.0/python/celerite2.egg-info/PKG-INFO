Description: # celerite2
        
        _celerite_ is an algorithm for fast and scalable Gaussian Process (GP)
        Regression in one dimension and this library, _celerite2_ is a re-write of the
        original [celerite project](https://celerite.readthedocs.io) to improve
        numerical stability and integration with various machine learning frameworks.  Documentation
        for this version can be found [here](https://celerite2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        This new implementation includes interfaces in Python and C++, with full support for
        Theano/PyMC3 and JAX.
        
        This documentation won't teach you the fundamentals of GP modeling but the best
        resource for learning about this is available for free online: [Rasmussen &
        Williams (2006)](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/). Similarly, the
        _celerite_ algorithm is restricted to a specific class of covariance functions
        (see [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09710) for more information
        and [a recent generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05799) for extensions
        to structured two-dimensional data). If you need scalable GPs with more general
        covariance functions, [GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai/) might be a good choice.
