*celerite* is an algorithm for fast and scalable Gaussian Process (GP)
Regression in one dimension and this library, *celerite2* is a re-write of the
original `celerite project <https://celerite.readthedocs.io>`_ to improve
numerical stability and integration with various machine learning frameworks.
This implementation includes interfaces in Python and C++, with full support for
Theano/PyMC3 and JAX.

This documentation won't teach you the fundamentals of GP modeling but the best
resource for learning about this is available for free online: `Rasmussen &
Williams (2006) <http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/>`_. Similarly, the
*celerite* algorithm is restricted to a specific class of covariance functions
(see `the original paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09710>`_ for more
information and `a recent generalization <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05799>`_
for extensions to structured two-dimensional data). If you need scalable GPs
with more general covariance functions, `GPyTorch <https://gpytorch.ai/>`_ might
be a good choice.

*celerite2* is being actively developed in `a public repository on GitHub
<https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/celerite2>`_ so if you have any trouble, `open an issue
<https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/celerite2/issues>`_ there.
