Code Development Guidelines
***************************

This document describes the coding requirements and guidelines to be
followed during the development of PlasmaPy and affiliated packages.

Code written for PlasmaPy must be compatible with Python 3.7 and
later.

Coding Style
============

TL;DR: use pre-commit
---------------------

PlasmaPy has a configuration for the `pre-commit framework
<https://pre-commit.com/>`_ that takes care of style mostly automatically.
Install it with `pip install pre-commit`, then use `pre-commit install` within
the repository.

This will cause pre-commit to download the right versions of linters we use,
then run an automated style checking suite on every commit.  Do note that this
works better with a `git add`, then `git commit` workflow than a `git commit
-a` workflow â€” that way, you can check via `git diff` what the automated
changes actually did.

Note that the "Style linters / pre-commit (pull_request)" part of our
Continuous Integration system can and will (metaphorically) shout at you if it
finds you didn't apply the linters. Also note that the linters' output may vary
with version, so, rather than apply `black` and `isort` manually, let
pre-commit do the version management for you instead!

Our pre-commit suite can be found in `.pre-commit-config.yaml
<https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml>`_.
It includes

* `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to automatically
  format code and ensure a consistent code style throughout the
  package
* `isort <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`_ to
  automatically sort imports.
* `nbqa <https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA>`_ to automatically apply the above
  to example notebooks as well.
* a few tools for `requirements.txt`, `.yml` files and the like.

PlasmaPy Code Style Guide, codified
-----------------------------------

* PlasmaPy follows the `PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code
  <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.  This style choice
  helps ensure that the code will be consistent and readable.

  * Line lengths should be chosen to maximize the readability and
    elegance of the code.  The maximum line length for Python code in
    PlasmaPy is 88 characters.

  * Docstrings and comments should generally be limited to
    about 72 characters.

* During code development, use
  `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ to automatically
  format code and ensure a consistent code style throughout the
  package and `isort <https://pycqa.github.io/isort/>`_ to
  automatically sort imports.

* Follow the existing coding style within a subpackage.  This includes,
  for example, variable naming conventions.

* Use standard abbreviations for imported packages when possible, such
  as ``import numpy as np``, ``import matplotlib as mpl``, ``import
  matplotlib.pyplot as plt``, and ``import astropy.units as u``.

* ``__init__.py`` files for modules should not contain any significant
  implementation code, but it can contain a docstring describing the
  module and code related to importing the module.  Any substantial
  functionality should be put into a separate file.

* Use absolute imports, such as
  ``from plasmapy.particles import Particle``, rather than relative
  imports such as ``from ..particles import Particle``.

* Use ``Optional[type]`` for type hinted keyword arguments with a
  default value of ``None``.

* There should be at least one pun per 1284 lines of code.

* Avoid using `lambda` to define functions, as this notation may be
  unfamiliar to newcomers to Python.


Branches, commits, and pull requests
====================================

Before making any changes, it is prudent to update your local
repository with the most recent changes from the development
repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  git fetch upstream

Changes to PlasmaPy should be made using branches.  It is usually best
to avoid making changes on your master branch so that it can be kept
consistent with the upstream repository.  Instead we can create a new
branch for the specific feature that you would like to work on:

.. code-block:: bash

  git branch *your-new-feature*

Descriptive branch names such as `grad-shafranov` or
`adding-eigenfunction-poetry` are helpful, while vague names like
`edits` are considered harmful.  After creating your branch locally,
let your fork of PlasmaPy know about it by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  git push --set-upstream origin *your-new-feature*

It is also useful to configure git so that only the branch you are
working on gets pushed to GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

  git config --global push.default simple

Once you have set up your fork and created a branch, you are ready to
make edits to PlasmaPy.  Switch to your new branch by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout *your-new-feature*

Go ahead and modify files with your favorite text editor.  Be sure to
include tests and documentation with any new functionality.  We
recommend reading about `best practices for scientific computing
<https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745>`_.  PlasmaPy uses the
`PEP 8 style guide for Python code
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ and the `numpydoc format
for docstrings
<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt>`_
to maintain consistency and readability.  New contributors should not
worry too much about precisely matching these styles when first
submitting a pull request, as the `PEP8 Speaks
<http://pep8speaks.com/>`_ GitHub integration will check pull requests
for PEP 8 compatibility, and further changes to the style can be
suggested during code review.

You may periodically commit changes to your branch by running

.. code-block:: bash

  git add filename.py
  git commit -m "*brief description of changes*"

Committed changes may be pushed to the corresponding branch on your
GitHub fork of PlasmaPy using

.. code-block:: bash

  git push origin *your-new-feature*

or, more simply,

.. code-block:: bash

  git push

Once you have completed your changes and pushed them to the branch on
GitHub, you are ready to make a pull request.  Go to your fork of
PlasmaPy in GitHub.  Select "Compare and pull request".  Add a
descriptive title and some details about your changes.  Then select
"Create pull request".  Other contributors will then have a chance to
review the code and offer contructive suggestions.  You can continue
to edit the pull request by changing the corresponding branch on your
PlasmaPy fork on GitHub.  After a pull request is merged into the
code, you may delete the branch you created for that pull request.

Commit Messages
---------------
Good commit messages communicate context and intention to other
developers and to our future selves.  They provide insight into why we
chose a particular implementation, and help us avoid past mistakes.

Suggestions on `how to write a git commit message
<https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`_:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line

* Limit the subject line to 50 characters

* Capitalize the subject line

* Do not end the subject line with a period

* Use the imperative mood in the subject line

* Wrap the body at 72 characters

* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Documentation
=============

* All public classes, methods, and functions should have docstrings
  using the numpydoc format.

* Docstrings may be checked locally using
  `pydocstyle <http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/latest/>`_.

* These docstrings should include usage examples.

Warnings and Exceptions
=======================

* Debugging can be intensely frustrating when problems arise and the
  associated error messages do not provide useful information on the
  source of the problem.  Warnings and error messages must be helpful
  enough for new users to quickly understand any problems that arise.

* "Errors should never pass silently."  Users should be notified when
  problems arise by either issuing a warning or raising an exception.

* The exceptions raised by a method should be described in the
  method's docstring.  Documenting exceptions makes it easier for
  future developers to plan exception handling.

Units
=====

* Code within PlasmaPy must use SI units to minimize the chance of
  ambiguity, and for consistency with the recognized international
  standard.  Physical formulae and expressions should be in base SI
  units.

  * Functions should not accept floats when an Astropy Quantity is
    expected.  In particular, functions should not accept floats and
    make the assumption that the value will be in SI units.

  * A common convention among plasma physicists is to use
    electron-volts (eV) as a unit of temperature.  Strictly speaking,
    this unit corresponds not to temperature but is rather a measure
    of the thermal energy per particle.  Code within PlasmaPy must use
    the kelvin (K) as the unit of temperature to avoid unnecessary
    ambiguity.

* PlasmaPy uses the astropy.units package to give physical units to
  values.

  * All units packages available in Python presently have some
    limitations, including incompatibility with some NumPy and SciPy
    functions.  These limitations are due to issues within NumPy
    itself.  Many of these limitations are being resolved, but require
    upstream fixes.

* Dimensionless units may be used when appropriate, such as for
  certain numerical simulations.  The conventions and normalizations
  should be clearly described in docstrings.

Equations and Physical Formulae
===============================

* If a quantity has several names, then the function name should be
  the one that provides the most physical insight into what the
  quantity represents.  For example, ``gyrofrequency`` indicates
  gyration, whereas ``Larmor_frequency`` indicates that this frequency
  is somehow related to someone named Larmor.  Similarly, using
  ``omega_ce`` as a function name will make the code less readable to
  people who are unfamiliar with this particular notation.

* Physical formulae should be inputted without first evaluating all of
  the physical constants.  For example, the following line of code
  obscures information about the physics being represented:

>>> omega_ce = 1.76e7*(B/u.G)*u.rad/u.s   # doctest: +SKIP

  In contrast, the following line of code shows the exact formula
  which makes the code much more readable.

>>> omega_ce = (e * B) / (m_e * c)       # doctest: +SKIP

  The origins of numerical coefficients in formulae should be
  documented.

* Docstrings should describe the physics associated with these
  quantities in ways that are understandable to students who are
  taking their first course in plasma physics while still being useful
  to experienced plasma physicists.

* SI units that were named after a person should not be capitalized
  except at the beginning of a sentence.

* Some plasma parameters depend on more than one quantity with
  the same units.  In the following line, it is difficult to discern which
  is the electron temperature and which is the ion temperature.

  >>> ion_sound_speed(1e6*u.K, 2e6*u.K)  # doctest: +SKIP

  Remembering that "explicit is better than implicit", it is more
  readable and less prone to errors to write:

  >>> ion_sound_speed(T_i=1e6*u.K, T_e=2e6*u.K)    # doctest: +SKIP

* SI units that were named after a person should be lower case except at
  the beginning of a sentence, even if their symbol is capitalized. For
  example, kelvin is a unit while Kelvin was a scientist.


Angular Frequencies
===================

Unit conversions involving angles must be treated with care.  Angles
are dimensionless but do have units.  Angular velocity is often given
in units of radians per second, though dimensionally this is
equivalent to inverse seconds.  Astropy will treat radians
dimensionlessly when using the ``dimensionless_angles`` equivalency,
but ``dimensionless_angles`` does not account for the multiplicative
factor of ``2*pi`` that is used when converting between frequency (1 /
s) and angular frequency (rad / s).  An explicit way to do this
conversion is to set up an equivalency between cycles/s and Hz:

>>> from astropy import units as u
>>> f_ce = omega_ce.to(u.Hz, equivalencies=[(u.cy/u.s, u.Hz)])   # doctest: +SKIP

However, ``dimensionless_angles`` does work when dividing a velocity
by an angular frequency to get a length scale:

>>> d_i = (c/omega_pi).to(u.m, equivalencies=u.dimensionless_angles())    # doctest: +SKIP

.. _example_notebooks:

Examples
========

.. _docs/notebooks: https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/tree/master/docs/notebooks
.. _nbsphinx: https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Examples in PlasmaPy are written as Jupyter notebooks, taking advantage
of their mature ecosystems. They are located in `docs/notebooks`_. `nbsphinx`_
takes care of executing them at documentation build time and including them
in the documentation.

Please note that it is necessary to store notebooks with their outputs stripped
(use the "Edit -> Clear all outputs" option). This accomplishes two goals:

1. helps with versioning the notebooks, as binary image data is not stored in
   the notebook
2. signals `nbsphinx` that it should execute the notebook.

.. note::

  In the future, verifying and running this step may be automated via a GitHub bot.
  Currently, reviewers should ensure that submitted notebooks have outputs stripped.

If you have an example notebook that includes packages unavailable in the
documentation building environment (e.g., `bokeh`) or runs some heavy
computation that should not be executed on every commit, *keep the outputs in
the notebook* but store it in the repository with a `preexecuted_` prefix, e.g.
`preexecuted_full_3d_mhd_chaotic_turbulence_simulation.ipynb`.

.. _asv-docs: https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

PlasmaPy has a set of `asv`_ benchmarks that monitor performance of its
functionalities.  This is meant to protect the package from performance
regressions. The benchmarks can be viewed at `benchmarks`_. They're
generated from results located in `benchmarks-repo`_. Detailed
instructions on writing such benchmarks can be found at `asv-docs`_.
Up-to-date instructions on running the benchmark suite will be located in
