Feedback and Communication
==========================

`Matrix chat <https://app.element.io/#/room/#plasmapy:matrix.org>`__
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The primary communication channel for PlasmaPy, and the quickest way to ask
a question and get a response, is our `Matrix room
<https://app.element.io/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org>`__, which is also
bridged (mirrored) to `Gitter <https://gitter.im/PlasmaPy/Lobby>`__.

`GitHub Discussions <https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/discussions>`__
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

PlasmaPy's `GitHub Discussions page
<https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/discussions>`__ is a great place to
suggest ideas, bring up discussion topics, and ask questions in threaded public
discussions.

`Mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy>`__
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We also have a `mailing
list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plasmapy>`__ that serves
as a less volatile discussion forum.

`Suggestion box <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdT3O5iHZrLJRuavFyzoR23PGy0Prfzx2SQOcwJGWtvHyT2lw/viewform?usp=sf_link>`__

if you would like to (optionally anonymously) suggest a feature/topic
for consideration. These will be reposted on the mailing list or
directly in GitHub issues, as appropriate, for further discussion.
