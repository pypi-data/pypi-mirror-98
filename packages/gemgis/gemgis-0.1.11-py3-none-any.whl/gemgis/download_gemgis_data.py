GemGIS is a Python-based, open-source spatial data processing library.
It is capable of preprocessing spatial data such as vector data
raster data, data obtained from online services and many more data formats.
GemGIS wraps and extends the functionality of packages known to the geo-community
such as GeoPandas, Rasterio, OWSLib, Shapely, PyVista, Pandas, and NumPy.
