the development of **GemGIS, a Python-based open-source library**.GemGIS wraps and extends the functionality of 
packages known to the geo-community such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/), 
[rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), [OWSLib](https://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/), 
[Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html), [PyGEOS](https://pygeos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), 
[PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and the 
geomodelling package [GemPy](https://docs.gempy.org/). The aim of GemGIS, as indicated by the name, is to become a 
bridge between conventional geoinformation systems (GIS) such as ArcGIS and QGIS, and geomodelling tools such as GemPy,
allowing simpler and more automated workflows from one environment to the other."""
