        spead2 is an implementation of the SPEAD_ protocol, with both Python and C++
        bindings. The *2* in the name indicates that this is a new implementation of
        the protocol; the protocol remains essentially the same. Compared to the
        PySPEAD_ implementation, spead2:
        
        - is at least an order of magnitude faster when dealing with large heaps;
        - correctly implements several aspects of the protocol that were implemented
          incorrectly in PySPEAD (bug-compatibility is also available);
        - correctly implements many corner cases on which PySPEAD would simply fail;
        - cleanly supports several SPEAD flavours (e.g. 64-40 and 64-48) in one
          module, with the receiver adapting to the flavour used by the sender;
        - supports Python 3;
        - supports asynchronous operation, using asyncio_.
