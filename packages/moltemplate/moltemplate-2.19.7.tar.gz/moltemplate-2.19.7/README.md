Moltemplate
===========

##  Description

[Moltemplate](http://moltemplate.org)
is a *general* cross-platform text-based molecule builder for
[**LAMMPS**](https://lammps.sandia.gov) and *(the TCL version of)*
[**ESPResSo**](http://moltemplate.org/espresso/).
Moltemplate was intended for building custom coarse-grained molecular models,
but it can be used to prepare realistic all-atom simulations as well.
It currently supports the
[**OPLSAA**](./examples/all_atom/force_field_OPLSAA),
[**OPLSUA**](./examples/all_atom/force_field_OPLSUA_united_atom),
[**LOPLSAA**(2015)](./examples/all_atom/force_field_OPLSAA/hexadecane),

[**COMPASS**](./examples/all_atom/force_field_COMPASS),
[**TraPPE**(1998)](./examples/coarse_grained/solvent_models/manybodywaterMW+hydrocarbonsTraPPE)
force fields,
the
[**ATB**](https://atb.uq.edu.au) molecule database,
and the
[**MOLC**](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/cp/c9cp04120f),

[**oxDNA2**](https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/DNA_model_introduction),
and
[**EFF**](./examples/misc_examples/explicit_electrons/eff_CH4)
molecular models (and others).
Moltemplate is interoperable with
[**ATB**](https://atb.uq.edu.au),
[**VMD/topotools**](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd),
[**PACKMOL**](http://m3g.iqm.unicamp.br/packmol/home.shtml),

[**struc2lammpsdf**](https://nanohub.org/resources/struc2lammpsdf),
and any other program that reads or generates LAMMPS data (.lmpdat) files.
(New force fields and examples are added continually by users.)


This repository contains 3 folders:
- [moltemplate](./moltemplate/): source code and force fields
- [doc](./doc/): documentation for moltemplate.sh, ltemplify.py, genpoly_lt.py, etc..
- [examples](./examples/): examples built with moltemplate

### Documentation

The best way to learn how to use moltemplate is to find an example
which is similar to the system that you wish to simulate and modify it.
This repository includes approximately 50 [examples](./examples).
Some of the moltemplate examples are also demonstrated (with pictures)
[here](http://moltemplate.org/visual_examples.html).

All moltemplate users should probably read chapter 4 of the
[reference manual](./doc/moltemplate_manual.pdf)
*(It's only a few pages long.  The first 3 chapters are optional.)*
In addition, there are also several
[talks/tutorials](http://moltemplate.org/doc/talks.html)
online.


### Limitations for preparing all-atom simulations

Moltemplate [does *not* choose atom types automatically ("atom typing")](http://moltemplate.org/force_field_recommendations.html),
and currently cannot be used to build all-atom proteins from scratch.
3rd-party tools may be needed to calculate atomic partial charges accurately.
Some suggestions for selecting the appropriate atom types for your molecules
are provided [here](http://moltemplate.org/force_field_recommendations.html).
*(Users who are unsure how to choose atom types are 
encouraged to use
the [ATB](https://atb.uq.edu.au) database,
or use the DREIDING force field which has simple
[atom type rules](./doc/DREIDING_Label_Manual.pdf),
or *use a 3rd-party molecule-builder that supports atom typing
(such as [EMC](http://montecarlo.sourceforge.net/))*.
If necessary, you can then convert the
molecular simulation files created earlier into LAMMPS format using
[OpenBabel](https://open-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FileFormats/The_LAMMPS_data_format.html "Convert 3rd party sim files to LAMMPS DATA format").
If these files are incomplete or need additional modifications, you can use
[ltemplify.py](./doc/doc_ltemplify.md),
to extract individual molecules from the LAMMPS DATA file, and
modify them or combine them with other molecules using moltemplate.)*



## Typical usage

```
    moltemplate.sh [-atomstyle style] [-pdb/-xyz coord_file] [-vmd] system.lt
```


## Installation Instructions

Note: There are **two ways** to install moltemplate:
1) using pip
2) editing your .bashrc file

Use one method or the other *(not both)*.

### Installation method 1: *Using pip*

If you are familiar with pip, then run the following command from
within the directory where this README file is located:

    pip3 install . --user    # (or "pip", if that fails)

This will install moltemplate for a single user.
If you are on a shared computer and you want to install moltemplate
system-wide, then use:

    sudo pip3 install .     # (or "pip", if that fails)

Later, you can uninstall moltemplate using:

    pip3 uninstall moltemplate   #(prepend "sudo" if you did that earlier)


#### Troubleshooting (method 1)

Again, if you get the error "command not found",
try using "pip" instead of "pip3".

If that fails, install the
[anaconda version of python](https://anaconda.com)
and then try installing moltemplate again (using "pip").
The *anaconda* version of python is recommended for several reasons.
Anaconda python includes *numpy*, and it will also
automatically update your [PATH](http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html)
for you so that *pip* works correctly.
*(If you don't use anaconda python, then it is possible
that you will need to edit your ~/.bashrc file and
manually append the default pip install bin directory
to the list of directories in your PATH variable.
This directory is usually named $HOME/.local/bin, or something similar.)*


#### Optional: Use a python virtual environment

Once you have *python* and *pip* (or *python3* and *pip3*) installed,
it's never a bad idea to install moltemplate into a temporary
python "virtual environment".
In a virtual environment, it should not be necessary to use "sudo" or "--user"
to get around permissions issues that sometimes occur when using *pip*.
(You can also uninstall moltemplate cleanly simply by deleting
the directory that stores the virtual environment where it was installed.
That directory is named "venv" in the example below.)
Although using a virtual python environment should not be necessary,
if you are curious how to do it then try downloading moltemplate
to "~/moltemplate", and run these commands:

    cd ~/moltemplate
    python -m venv venv     #(or "virtualenv venv" if using python2)
    # This will create a local directory named "venv".
    # You must "activate" your environment before use:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Then install moltemplate into this environment:
    pip install .
    # (Now do something useful with moltemplate...)

Note that if you use a virtual environment, you will have to enter
"source ~/moltemplate/venv/bin/activate" into a terminal
before you use that terminal to run moltemplate.
Virtual environments are
[explained here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)


If all this fails, then try installing moltemplate by manually updating your
\$PATH environment variable.  Instructions for doing that are included below.
(Either way, you must have a working version of python or python3 installed.)



### Installation method 2: *Editing .bashrc*

Alternatively, you can edit your $PATH environment variable manually to 
include the subdirectory where the "moltemplate.sh" script is located,
as well as the subdirectory where most of the python scripts are located.
Suppose the directory with this README file is named "moltemplate"
and is located in your home directory:

If you use the *BASH* shell, typically you would edit your
`~/.bashrc` file and add the following lines to the end of the file:

    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/moltemplate/moltemplate"
    export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/moltemplate/moltemplate/scripts"

(Some people prefer to put these lines in their `~/.profile`,
 or `~/.bash_profile` files instead `~/.bashrc`.  This should work also.)
If you use the *TCSH* shell, typically you would edit your
`~/.cshrc`, `~/.tcshrc` or `~/.login` files to contain the following lines:

    setenv PATH "$PATH:$HOME/moltemplate/moltemplate"
    setenv PATH "$PATH:$HOME/moltemplate/moltemplate/scripts"

After making these changes, you may need to start a new terminal (shell) for the changes to take effect.  If you do not know what a `PATH` environment variable is and are curious, read:
    http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html
(I receive this question often.)

*(Warning:
Do not install moltemplate this way if you are using "vipster",
"cellpack2moltemplate", or other software that has a moltemplate python
dependency.  In order to be able to be able to run "import moltemplate"
within python, as those programs do, moltemplate must be installed using
pip or pip3.)*


### WINDOWS installation suggestions

You can install both moltemplate and LAMMPS in windows, but you will first need to install the BASH shell environment on your computer.  I recommend installing [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) in windows together with a (debian-based) linux distribution with a lightweight desktop such as [xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org).  Alternatively, if you are using Windows 10 or later, you can try installing the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl)
*(which is text only)*
or
[Hyper-V](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/run-linux-hyper-v/).
Otherwise, if you are using an older version of windows, try installing
[CYGWIN](https://www.cygwin.com/) instead.

To use LAMMPS and moltemplate, you will also need to install (and learn
how to use) a text editor.  (Word, Wordpad, and Notepad will not work.)
If you are **NOT using WSL**, then you can use popular graphical text editors
such as Atom, Sublime, Notepad++, VSCode,
and the graphical versione of emacs and vim.
([Don't use these editors to edit files within the WSL environment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/6bu1d1/since_we_shouldnt_edit_files_stored_in_wsl_with/))
If you **ARE using WSL** then you are restricted to using non-graphical text
editors which you can safely install and run from within the WSL terminal.
These include: **nano**, **ne**, **emacs** (the text version),
**vim** (the text version), and **jove**.

## Requirements

Moltemplate requires the Bourne-shell, and a recent version of python
(3.5 or higher recommended), and can run on MacOS, linux, or windows,
if a suitable shell environment has been installed.
(Note that python 2.7 may also work, but you must edit your PATH to
install moltemplate instead of using *pip*.  Pip no longer works with
old versions of python.)

The *numpy* python module is also required.


## License

With the exception of one file
([ttree_lex.py](./moltemplate/ttree_lex.py)),
moltemplate is available under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

The remaining file, ([ttree_lex.py](./moltemplate/ttree_lex.py)),
is a modified version of the 
[shlex.py](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html) module,
which was released using the
[PSF license](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html).
Hence [ttree_lex.py](./moltemplate/ttree_lex.py) must also use this license.
(*The PSF is not a copyleft license.
It is similar to the BSD and MIT licenses and
[is compatible with the the GPL license](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html).)*
