    "\n",
    "Now we can add components to the model. In a rule-based model, there are several key components to a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Monomers`, which are the individual biochemical components\n",
    "* `Parameters`, which define parameter values, e.g. reaction rates and initial concentrations\n",
    "* `Rules`, which define transformations to monomers using *patterns*, together with their rates\n",
    "* `Observables`, which define patterns to match for counting biochemical complex concentrations\n",
    "* `Expressions`, which can be used in place of parameters to define rates as equations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Monomers can have internal *states*, e.g. an indicator of phosphorylation, and *binding sites*, which are used to combine monomers into *complexes*. A monomer or complex is referred to as a biochemical *species*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules use patterns to define transformations to sets of species. These patterns might specify only some aspects of the reactants. For example, if the phosphorylation state of a reactant is not important to a reaction, we can leave it out when specifying the reactant pattern. In this way, the reactant side of a rule can match against multiple species and generate multiple *reactions*. The process of converting rules into a set of reactions and species is called *network generation*.\n",
