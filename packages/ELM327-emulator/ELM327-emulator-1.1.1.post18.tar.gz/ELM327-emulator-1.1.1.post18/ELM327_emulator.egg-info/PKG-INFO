Description: ELM327-emulator
        ===============
        
        __A Python emulator of the ELM327 OBD-II adapter connected to a vehicle.__
        
        *ELM327-emulator* provides a virtual serial communication port to client applications (via [pseudo-terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal) function on UNIX/Linux, or via [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/) library on Windows) and simulates an [ELM327](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELM327) adapter connected to a vehicle through the [OBD-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) protocol. It includes a command-line interface for extensive monitoring and controlling.
        
        *ELM327-emulator* is agnostic of the client application accessing the serial port and has been tested with [python-OBD](https://github.com/brendan-w/python-OBD).
        
        An internal dictionary (named *ObdMessage*) allows configuring the emulation, which is currently set to reproduce the message flow generated by a Toyota Auris Hybrid car (through the `scenario car` option), including custom PIDs and can be easily configured to statically and dynamically update its dictionary to simulate OBDII answers produced by other vehicles.
        
        *ELM327-emulator* supports all protocols allowed by *python-OBD*; the included dictionary uses the *ISO 15765-4 CAN 11 bit ID 500 kbaud* protocol.
        
        *ELM327-emulator* also includes an auxiliary feature (*obd_dictionary*) that builds the PID dictionary of a specific vehicle by automatically querying all standard PIDs one by one (as well as querying additional custom PIDs specified by the user via CSV file). The dictionary can then be used to emulate the specific car.
