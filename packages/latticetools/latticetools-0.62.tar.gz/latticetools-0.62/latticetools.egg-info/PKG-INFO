Description: # latticetools
        
        Numpy and Matplotlib are great tools to model systems numerically and throw together quick plots, as well as highly specific, complex plots too. For example, a 2D distribution in $X$ and $Y$:
        
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        X, Y = np.ogrid[:100,:100]
        func = ((X - 50) * (1 / 50) **.5) ** 2 + (Y - 50)
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        plt.imshow(func, extent = (0, 100, 100, 0))
        plt.colorbar()
        plt.xlabel('Y')
        plt.ylabel('X')
        plt.show()
        ```

        It's not too hard to describe the distribution and plot it with a few lines of code. However, there can be situations where even this process can become repetitive and slow down work. For example, making small changes to the distribution and plotting again — this might require copying the plotting code lines or re-running the lines again in-place:
        
        
        ```python
        func2 = abs(func) ** .5
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        plt.imshow(func2, extent = (0, 100, 100, 0))
        plt.colorbar()
        plt.xlabel('Y')
        plt.ylabel('X')
        plt.show()
        ```

        This makes for a potentially cluttered and non-linear work process. latticetools was developed to streamline this procedure, both in terms of generating distributions and particularly in visually representing them.
        
        
        ```python
        import latticetools
        ```
        
        latticetools is a module that centralises the definition of a sampled n-dimensional space and takes care of all the details which depend on the sampling. Be it a 1-dimensional time-series or 3D volume of data, latticetools can be used to set-and-forget the sample spacing and limits of the data. latticetools's features include:
        * Easy production of consistent plots and imshows of 1D and 2D cross-sections of data arrays, with axis names and units defined once in the class instance definition;
        * The class deals with Fourier transforms, using `numpy.fft` or `pyfftw` under the hood, taking care of fftshifting and making spectral plotting simple;
        * Fields can be generated on the space by writing functions of the axis coordinates, and it is easy to perform common Fourier-based operations on them, including convolution, differentiation, or integration.
        
        Use of latticetools starts by instancizing the class `Space`, by providing a tuple of slices which represent the sample spacing (in the same way that a `numpy.ogrid[slices_tuple]` is set up — in fact, this happens under the hood). Once this is done, fields can be generated, which create ndarrays to represent the field. Alternatively, the `Space` instance can be used with external data in all the same ways.
        
        
        ```python
        sp = latticetools.Space(
            (slice(-2,2,.01),),
        )
        field_func = lambda X: np.sin(2 * np.pi * X / .2) * (abs(X) < 1.5)
        field = sp.generate_field(field_func)
        sp.show(field, '$\sin(X)$', titleas='ylabel')
        ```

        Taking the discrete Fourier transform can be a hassle, especially when getting one's head around frequency sampling for the n<sup>th</sup> time! latticetools helps by making it easy to produce the DFT, and has special plotting arguments to help show the usually complex fields:
        
        
        ```python
        f_dft = sp.dft(field)
        sp.show(
            f_dft, 
            dft = True, 
            title = 'Amplitude spectrum of the field', 
            titleas = 'title', 
            vmin = 1e-5,
        )
        sp.show(
            f_dft, 
            dft = True, 
            title = 'Amplitude spectrum of the field', 
            titleas = 'title', 
            vmin = 1e-3,
            lims = ((-10,10)),
        )
        ```
        
        
        ![jpeg](latticetools-intro/output_14_0.jpg)
        
        
        
        ![jpeg](latticetools-intro/output_14_1.jpg)
        
        
        
        
        
            [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x117840100>]
        
        
        
        In this case as expected, the sinusoidal field with a frequency of 0.2<sup>-1</sup>, its spectral peaks are found at ±5 cycles per unit distance.
        
        latticetools simply uses `numpy.fft` or `pyfftw` to perform frequency operations, and follows the convention of the DC term at the centre of the spectrum.
        
        The DFT can also be taken with zero-padding to enhance spectral sampling, as shown below. This can be accomplished by default, by setting the `factors` argument in the initialization of `Space`.
        
        
        ```python
        sp.factors = 5
        f_dft = sp.dft(field, axes = 0)
        im = sp.show(
            f_dft, 
            dft = True, 
            title = 'Amplitude spectrum of the field', 
            titleas = 'title', 
            vmin = 1e-3,
            lims = ((-10,10)),
        )
        ```
        
        
        ![jpeg](latticetools-intro/output_18_0.jpg)
        
        
        It might be expected that after oversampling the spectrum, performing the inverse DFT might produce the wrong-sized distribution. However, this is properly handled by telling latticetools what padding factor was used:
        
        
        ```python
        f_idft = sp.idft(f_dft, axes = 0)
        im = sp.show(
            f_idft, 
            title = 'Inverse DFT of the over-sampled DFT', 
            titleas = 'title',
        )
        ```
        
        
        ![jpeg](latticetools-intro/output_20_0.jpg)
        
        
        Another operation commonly performed with modelling is a spatial mapping, such as a stretch in the $X$-axis. Such one-to-one spatial mappings are assisted by the `space_warp` function. For example, if a field were defined on a line with coordinate $x$, then the field could be mapped to values at coordinates of $\theta$, where $x=\tan(\theta)$. This is performed under the hood by using scikit-image's warp, but uses coordinates instead of sample indices. First, a new space is defined; then a function is defined which gives the spatial mapping. A warper function can then be made, which when applied to a field gives a new field in the new space:
        
        
        ```python
        sp2 = latticetools.Space(
            (slice(-.5, .5, 1 / 1e5),),
            ('$\\theta$',),
            ('$\pi$',)
        )
        func_dest2source = lambda theta: ((np.tan(theta * np.pi)),)
        warper = latticetools.space_warp(sp, sp2, func_dest2source)
        field_warped = warper(field)
        sp2.show(field_warped, '$\sin(X)$', show = False, titleas='ylabel')
        plt.title('Warp according to $X = \\tan(\\theta)$')
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        
        ![jpeg](latticetools-intro/output_22_0.jpg)
        
        
        For higher-dimensional sample spaces, latticetools can help to visualize cross-sections of it, and keep track of sampling.
        
        
        ```python
        spatial_slices = (
            slice(0, 1000, 10),
            slice(0, 500, 10),
            slice(0,8, 1)
        )
        sp3 = latticetools.Space(
            slices = spatial_slices,
        )
        ```
        
        For closer hacking, the `numpy.ogrid` samples are easily accessible:
        
        
        ```python
        describer = lambda array: 'shape: {}, min: {}, max: {}, step: {}'.format(
            array.shape,
            array.min(),
            array.max(),
            array.flatten()[:2].ptp()
        )
        print('sp3.R is a length {} {} consisting of\n'.format(len(sp3.R), type(sp3.R)),'\n '.join(map(describer,sp3.R)))
        ```
        
            sp3.R is a length 3 <class 'list'> consisting of
             shape: (100, 1, 1), min: 0.0, max: 990.0, step: 10.0
             shape: (1, 50, 1), min: 0.0, max: 490.0, step: 10.0
             shape: (1, 1, 8), min: 0.0, max: 7.0, step: 1.0
        
        
        
        ```python
        field = sp3.generate_field(
            func = lambda X,Y,Z: (abs(X - 400) < 300) * np.hypot((Y - (400 - 200 * (Z - 4))) / 300, (X - 400) / 300),
        )
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        sp3.show(field, '$F(X,Y)$ @ $Z=4$', axes = (0, 1), coordinates = 4)
        sp3.show(field, '$F(Y,Z)$ @ $X=400$', axes = (1, 2), coordinates = 400, aspect = 'auto')
        sp3.show(field, '$F(X)$ @ $(Y,Z) = (100,6)$', axes = 0, coordinates = (100, 6))
        ```

        In higher-dimensional spaces, performing DFTs in specific dimensions is handled. When using numpy, multidimensional DFTs is usually done with nested function calls within function calls, which gets messy. Here, it is performed by listing the desired axes in one call. The unitary DFT is employed in this implementation, which eases scaling considerations in complex modelling. In this example, the DFT is performed in $Y$ and $Z$, before the resultant field is shown as a 2D distribution along various cross-sections:
        
        
        ```python
        field_yz_dft = sp3.dft(field, axes = (1,2))
        sp3.show(
            field_yz_dft, 
            '$\mathcal{F}_{(Y,Z)}[F](X,\\nu_Y)$  @ $\\nu_Z=0$ (DC)', 
            axes = (0, 1), 
            dft_axes = (1, 2), 
            coordinates = 0,
        )
        sp3.show(
            field_yz_dft, 
            '$\mathcal{F}_{(Y,Z)}[F](\\nu_Y,\\nu_Z)$  @ $X=400$', 
            axes = (1, 2), 
            dft_axes = (1, 2), 
            coordinates = 400,
            aspect = 'auto',
        )
        sp3.show(
            field_yz_dft, 
            '$\mathcal{F}_{(Y,Z)}[F](X)$  @ $(\\nu_Y,\\nu_Z) = (0.25, 0.1)$ unit$^{-1}$', 
            axes = 0, 
            coordinates = (0.25, 0.1),
        )

        Where latticetools becomes very useful is when using externally-provided distributions. This could be experimental data or images:
        
        
        ```python
        from scipy.misc import face
        field = face(gray=True)[::-1].astype(int)
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        spatial_slices = tuple(slice(shi) for shi in field.shape)
        sp4 = latticetools.Space(
            slices = spatial_slices,
            factors = (3,3),
            axis_units = ['pixel'] * 2,
            vert_axes=0,
        )
        im = sp4.show(field, 'Scipy\'s face')
        im = sp4.show(
            field, 
            'Scipy\'s face; using the matrix-style\nof \"zeroth element in upper left\"',
            origin = 'upper',
        )
        ```
        
        
        ![jpeg](latticetools-intro/output_33_0.jpg)
        
        
        
        ![jpeg](latticetools-intro/output_33_1.jpg)
        
        
        A DFT can be taken in any particular axis:
        
        
        ```python
        field_xdft = sp4.dft(field, axes = 0)
        im = sp4.show(field_xdft, 'X-DFT of Scipy\'s face', dft_axes = 0, vmin = 1e-4)
        ```
        
        
        ![jpeg](latticetools-intro/output_35_0.jpg)
        
        
        Plotting into more complex subplots can be performed by setting up the figure using `pyplot`, and then setting the current axis as one of the created axes (`pyplot.sca(...)`). Then, when using `space.show`, use the kwarg `show = False` in order to avoid calling `pyplot.show()`:
        
        
        ```python
        dfield_dy = sp4.differentiate(field, axis = 1)
        f,a = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize = (12,3),)
        plt.sca(a[0])
        sp4.show(
            dfield_dy, 
            '$\partial\mathrm{Face}/\partial Y$', 
            show = False
        )
        dfdy_xdft = sp4.dft(dfield_dy, axes = 0)
        plt.sca(a[1])
        sp4.show(
            abs(dfield_dy), 
            '$\left |\partial\mathrm{Face}/\partial Y\\right |$ @ X=400', 
            axes = 1, 
            coordinates = 400,
            show = False
        )
        plt.sca(a[2])
        sp4.show(
            dfdy_xdft, 
            '$\mathcal{F}_X[\partial\mathrm{Face}/\partial Y]$',
            dft_axes = 0,
        )

        On the subject of DFTs, latticetools provides a simple way to implement convolutions. This is where padding the input fields comes in handy, in order to avoid periodicity artefacts. Here, a Gaussian blur is demonstrated:
        
        
        ```python
        sigma = 5
        gauss_func = lambda R: np.exp( - .5 * sum( (Ri / sigma) ** 2 for Ri in R)) / (2 * np.pi * sigma * sigma)
        kernel = sp4.generate_field(gauss_func, split = False, origin = True)
        sp4.show(kernel, 'Convolution kernel', lims = [[Ri.mean() + i * sigma * 5 for i in (-1,1)] for Ri in sp4.R])
        ```

        Convolution involves multiplication in frequency space. When `space.convolve` is called, the input field is padded not with zeros, but with tiles of the input field reversed spatially. This avoids edge artefacts to some extent.
        
        
        ```python
        field_convolved = sp4.convolve(field, kernel)
        sp4.show(field_convolved, 'Blurred face')
        ```

        `space_warp` works in an arbitrary number of dimensions, as demonstrated here:
        
        
        ```python
        centre = 340, 650
        zoomturn = lambda x, y: (centre[0] + (y - centre[1])**3 / 1e5, centre[1] + (x - centre[0]) / 2.5, )
        warper = latticetools.space_warp(sp4, sp4, func_dest2source = zoomturn)
        
        sp4.show(field, 'Face')
        sp4.show(warper(field), 'Warped face')
        ```
