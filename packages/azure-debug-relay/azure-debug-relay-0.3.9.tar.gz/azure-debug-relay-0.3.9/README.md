# Azure Debug Relay for Python

Azure Debug Relay - is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension and a Python package for distributed remote debugging. It solves a problem of debugging code in real development and production environments,
simultaneously across multiple nodes and in different networks.

* [Azure Debug Relay extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VladKolesnikov-vladkol.azure-debug-relay) on Visual Studio Marketplace
* [azure-debug-relay](https://pypi.org/project/azure-debug-relay/) package on PyPI

Azure Debug Relay uses [debugpy](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy) and [Azure Relay](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-relay/relay-what-is-it) service to create a debugging tunnel between 2 machines:

1. Your local Visual Studio Code debugger in `listen` mode.
1. Your remote code in `attach` mode.

Both machines can be isolated behind NAT or virtual networks - all they need is to be able to connect to Azure Relay resource.
Azure Relay carries a secure tunnel, just as if these machines were in the same VPN.

![Azure Relay Debugging Bridge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladkol/azure-debug-relay/main/images/debug-relay-diagram.png)

The debugging tunnel is handled by **[Azure Relay Bridge](https://github.com/vladkol/azure-relay-bridge)** utility which is downloaded and installed automatically by Azure Debug Relay. Azure Relay Bridge can maintain secure TCP and UDP tunnels for different purposes.

> We currently use a private fork of [Azure Relay Bridge](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge) repo.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6+
* debugpy 1.2.1+
* Visual Studio Code 1.34+ (for using VS Code extension)

Azure Relay Bridge tool is a .NET Core application, so you may need  to install `apt-transport-https` and other .NET Core 3.1 Runtime prerequisites on [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux) and [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=netcore31).

> You don't have to install .NET Runtime itself - Azure Relay Bridge builds are self-contained.

### Supported Operating Systems

* Ubuntu 18+
* Debian 10+
* macOS 10+
* Windows 10

## Installation

**On the debugger side (usually your dev machine with Visual Studio code)**:

> Install [Azure Debug Relay extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VladKolesnikov-vladkol.azure-debug-relay) from Visual Studio Marketplace.

**On the server side**:

> `python3 -m pip install azure-debug-relay`

## Usage

Before you start debugging with Azure Debug Relay, there are 3 places you configure it:

1. **Azure Portal or CLI** where you create an Azure Relay resource and an Azure Hybrid Connection in it.
1. **Local dev machine** where you run Visual Studio Code, its Python extension,
and Azure Debug Relay extension with 2 configuration settings.
1. **Remote machine** where you run the same code files that open locally in VS Code,
with 2 lines that initiate debugging session for a certain request on an execution flow.

### In Azure Portal

1. [Create Azure Relay resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Relay). Better make one in a region closest to your location.
1. Once created, switch to the resource, and select `Hybrid Connections` option in the vertical panel.
1. Add a hybrid connection (`+ Hybrid Connection` button), give it a memorable name (e.g. `test` ðŸ™‚) - this is your **Hybrid Connection Name**.
1. Switch to that new hybrid connection, then select `Shared Access Policies` in the vertical panel.
1. Add a new policy with `Send` and `Listen` permissions.
1. Once created, copy its `Primary Connection String`, this is your **Connection String**.

#### **Azure CLI version**

Choose your name instead of `mydebugrelay1` for an Azure Relay resource, and your custom name for Hybrid Connection instead of `debugrelayhc1`. Same applies to `debugRelayResourceGroup` as resource group.

```cmd
az group create --name debugRelayResourceGroup --location westus2

az relay namespace create --resource-group debugRelayResourceGroup --name mydebugrelay1 --location westus2

az relay hyco create --resource-group debugRelayResourceGroup --namespace-name mydebugrelay1 --name debugrelayhc1

az relay hyco authorization-rule create --resource-group debugRelayResourceGroup --namespace-name mydebugrelay1 --hybrid-connection-name debugrelayhc1 --name sendlisten --rights Send Listen

az relay hyco authorization-rule keys list --resource-group debugRelayResourceGroup --namespace-name mydebugrelay1 --hybrid-connection-name debugrelayhc1 --name sendlisten
```

Last command will show you something like this:

```json
{
  "keyName": "sendlisten",
  "primaryConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://mydebugrelay1.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=sendlisten;SharedAccessKey=REDACTED1;EntityPath=debugrelayhc1",
  "primaryKey": "REDACTED1",
  "secondaryConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://mydebugrelay1.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=sendlisten;SharedAccessKey=REDACTED2;EntityPath=debugrelayhc1",
  "secondaryKey": "REDACTED2"
}
```

Use `primaryConnectionString` or `secondaryConnectionString` value as your **Connection String**.

**Hybrid Connection Name** would be the one you choose instead of `debugrelayhc1`.
</details>

### Remotely with `remote_server_demo.py` or your code

Remote Server example (in `samples/simple_demo/remote_server_demo.py`) assumes that Azure Relay credentials will are passes via `.azrelay.json` file in the current directory or via environment variables. Therefore, you have 2 options:

**Option 1**: Create `.azrelay.json` file in your workspace directory root or whatever directory will be "current",
and set 2 variables:

1. `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` to your **Connection String**.
1. `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_NAME` to your **Hybrid Connection Name**.

For example:

```json
{
  "AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING": "Endpoint=sb://mydebugrelay1.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=sendlisten;SharedAccessKey=REDACTED1;EntityPath=debugrelayhc1",
  "AZRELAY_CONNECTION_NAME": "debugrelayhc1"
}
```

Make sure you add `.azrelay.json` to `.gitignore` so won't be committed.

**Option 2**: You can assign these 2 variables as environment variables: `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` and `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_NAME` instead.

### Prepare local Visual Studio Code

Use `.azrelay.json` file in the root of your workspace as above or `.vscode/settings.json` with the following settings (actual values are ones you have):

```json
{
  "azure-debug-relay.azrelay-connection-string": "Endpoint=sb://your-relay.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=key_name;SharedAccessKey=REDACTED;EntityPath=test",

  "azure-debug-relay.azrelay-connection-name": "test",
}
```

> Whenever Azure Debug Relay VS Code extension detects non-empty `azure-debug-relay.hybrid-connection-string` and `azure-debug-relay.hybrid-connection-name` settings (`vscode/settings.json`) or `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` and `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_NAME` in `.azrelay.json` file, it launches Azure Relay Bridge every time a debugging session with debugpy in `listen` mode is about to begin. If extension settings are not empty and `.azrelay.json` is present, Azure Relay Bridge prefers values from the extension settings (`vscode/settings.json`).

Visual Studio Code extension ignores `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_STRING` and `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_NAME` environment variables.

### Start debugging in Visual Studio Code

This step must be done on your dev machine in Visual Studio Code before launching the remote code.

1. Open `remote_server_demo.py` and put a breakpoint in `do_work()` function.
1. Makes sure your `.vscode/launch.json` has `Python: Listen 5678` configuration as in this repo's `.vscode/launch.json`.
1. Start debugging in your local Visual Studio Code in `Python: Listen 5678` configuration.

Notice how the debugger maps paths on the local and the remote machines.
If your code has a different structure remotely, you may need to provide more sophisticated path mappings. Here is that piece in `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
"pathMappings": [
    {
        "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "remoteRoot": "."
    }
]
```

It tells VS Code that the workspace directory locally is mapped to the "current" directory remotely.

When the debugger looks goes through a file remotely, it needs to find the corresponding file in your local VS Code workspace.
When debugging `remote_server_demo.py`, the debugger maps `./samples/simple_demo/remote_server_demo.py` remotely to `${workspaceFolder}/samples/simple_demo/remote_server_demo.py` locally.

### Launch the example on the remote machine

1. Clone the repo.
1. Start `python3 ./samples/simple_demo/remote_server_demo.py --debug=attach`. Notice that current directory must contain `.azrelay.json` file unless configured with environment variables.

> Terminal session where you start #2 must have the repo's directory as current directory - for a reason of mapping local and remote directories.

If everything works as it's supposed to, you will hit a breakpoint in your local Visual Studio Code.

## Azure Debug Relay Python API

`remote_server_demo.py` shows how you can use Azure Debug Relay (azure-debug-relay package) with your code.

**azdebugrelay** module contains DebugRelay class that install and launches Azure Relay Bridge:

```python
from azdebugrelay import DebugRelay, DebugMode, debugpy_connect_with_timeout

access_key_or_connection_string = "AZURE RELAY HYBRID CONNECTION STRING OR ACCESS KEY"
relay_connection_name = "HYBRID CONNECTION NAME" # your Hybrid Connection name
debug_mode = DebugMode.Connect # or DebugMode.WaitForConnection if connecting from another end
hybrid_connection_url = "HYBRID CONNECTION URL" # can be None if access_key_or_connection_string is a connection string
host = "127.0.0.1" # local hostname or ip address the debugger starts on
port = 5678 # any available port that you can use within your machine, may be a list of multiple ports
debugpy_timeout = 15 # 15 seconds for debugpy to connect

debug_relay = DebugRelay(access_key_or_connection_string, relay_connection_name, debug_mode, hybrid_connection_url, host, port)
debug_relay.open()

# attach to a remote debugger (usually from remote server code) with debug_mode = DebugMode.Connect
debugpy_connect_with_timeout(host, port, debugpy_timeout) # use instead of debugpy.connect
# if debug_mode = DebugMode.WaitForConnection, we are going to listen instead
# debugpy.listen((host, port))
# if debug_mode = DebugMode.WaitForConnection, you can start DebugRelay on multiple ports (ports parameter is a list)
# debugpy.listen must be called with each of these ports

# Debug, debug, debug
# ...
# ...

debug_relay.close()
```

* `access_key_or_connection_string` - SAS Policy key or Connection String for Azure Relay Hybrid Connection. Must have `Send` and `Listen` permissions
* `relay_connection_name` - name of the Hybrid Connection
* `debug_mode` - debug connection mode. `DebugMode.WaitForConnection` when starting in listening mode, `DebugMode.Connect` for attaching to a remote debugger.
* `hybrid_connection_url` - Hybrid Connection URL. Required when access_key_or_connection_string as an access key, otherwise is ignored and may be None.
* `host` - Local hostname or ip address the debugger starts on, `127.0.0.1` by default
* `port` - debugging port, `5678` by default

> We added `debugpy_connect_with_timeout` method on top of **debugpy.connect()**.
It accepts `connect_timeout_seconds` parameter - how long it should wait for `debugpy.connect()` to connect.
If the connection is not successfully made within the timeout,
the debugging session aborts, and that can be handled in your code:
`debugpy_connect_with_timeout()` returns `True` if the connection was successful, and `False` otherwise.

Notice that DebugRelay accepts multiple ports to work with (**`ports` parameter is a list**).
That's because Azure Relay Bridge support forwarding on multiple ports.
This feature is primarily used by DebugRelay internally
for [Simultaneous distributed debugging](#simultaneous-distributed-debugging).

### Azure Machine Learning samples

**Simple Azure ML sample** is located in `samples/azure_ml_simple` directory.

It has 2 components:

1. `deploy_and_run.py` script that deploys and launches an Azure ML pipeline with a single step.
2. `steps/train.py` script which contains that simple step.

Look at the [sample's readme file](samples/azure_ml_simple/README.md).

**Advanced Azure Machine Learning sample** is located in `samples/azure_ml_advanced`, and demonstrates a complex debugging scenario with parallel steps.

Look at the [advanced sample's readme file](samples/azure_ml_advanced/README.md).

## Simultaneous distributed debugging

You can debug multiple simultaneously running remote nodes using different ports.
Each execution flow you want to debug must use a separate port - both locally and remotely.

In Visual Studio code, it is achievable via so called "[compound launch configurations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_compound-launch-configurations)".
Compound launch configurations combine multiple launch configurations, and therefore start them at the same time.

Each launch configuration must be a Python `listen` configuration with a unique name and port:

```json
{
  "name": "Python: Listen 5678",
  "type": "python",
  "request": "attach",
  "listen": {
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 5678
  },
  "pathMappings": [
      {
          "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
          "remoteRoot": "."
      }
  ]
}
```

You need as many launch configurations as number of simultaneous execution flows or nodes you'd like to debug.
Then you combine them in `.vscode/launch.json` to as a compound:

```json
"compounds": [
  {
    "name": "Python: AML Advanced 3 Listeners",
    "configurations": [
      "Python: Listen 5678", 
      "Python: Listen 5679",
      "Python: Listen 5680"
    ]
  }
]
```

Remotely, each node you debug should be aware of the port number it should use.
That port number must be passed to `DebugRelay` object and `debugpy_connect_with_timeout()`.

## Troubleshooting

Why using [Azure Relay Bridge](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge) which is a .NET Core application that we have to install and use via `subprocess` calls?

Reasons:

1. Azure Relay has SDKs for .NET, Java, and Node. [No Python SDK or examples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay/issues/28#issuecomment-390778193).
1. Azure Relay Bridge does a lot of things we have to implement otherwise. It is a great tool that can help you connecting different networks for many purposes: for RDP, SSH and other protocols over TCP or UDP.

A [private fork](https://github.com/vladkol/azure-relay-bridge) we are currently using is only to provide .NET Core 3.1 builds of the most recent code. There is a pending pul-requests: [one](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge/pull/22) and [two](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge/pull/19).

### Known issues

> **Extension and python module fail complaining about `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_NAME` or `azrelay-connection-name`**.

**Reason**: It is a breaking change in 0.2.0. We changed configuration and environment variables name from `AZRELAY_NAME` to `AZRELAY_CONNECTION_NAME`. VS Code extension setting names we also renamed:

* `hybrid-connection-string` to **azrelay-connection-string**
* `azrelay-connection-name` to **azrelay-connection-name**

**Workaround**: Modify your `.azrelay.json`, environment variables or `.vscode/settings.json` files accordingly.

> **On macOS, there may be a situation when Azure Relay Bridge (`azbridge`) cannot connect when creating a local forwarder** (`-L` option).

**Reason**: .NET Core wants you to add your Computer Name to `/etc/hosts` file, and make sure the hostname is configured.

**Workaround**: Make necessary edits of `/etc/hosts` file, and configure hostname:

1. Look for your computer's name in `Settings â†’ Sharing`.
1. Run the following command: `scutil --set HostName "your-computer-name"`. (**replace `your-computer-name` with your computer's name**)
1. Open `/etc/hosts` in a text editor in *sudo* mode (VS Code can save it later in *sudo* mode).
1. Add the following line (**replace `your-computer-name` with your computer's name**). Save the file.

```text
127.0.0.1   your-computer-name
```

> **I launched the debugger as described and nothing happened**

**Reason**: you *probably* didn't put a breakpoint in your VS Code locally. Make sure that breakpoint is in a place that your server process actually runs through.

> **I do everything right, but nothing works**

**Reason**: Stop all debugging sessions (if any). Kill all `azbridge` processes locally and remotely. Try again.
