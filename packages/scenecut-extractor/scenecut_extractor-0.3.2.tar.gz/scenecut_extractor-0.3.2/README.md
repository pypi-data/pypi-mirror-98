# Scenecut Extractor

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scenecut-extractor.svg)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scenecut-extractor)

Extract scenecuts from video files using ffmpeg.

This tool uses the [`select` filter](http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#select_002c-aselect) from ffmpeg to determine the scene cut probability of adjacent frames, and allows users to determine which frames (or at which timestamps) the scene cuts happen.

# Requirements

- Python 3.5 or higher
- FFmpeg:
    - download a static build from [their website](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html))
    - put the `ffmpeg` executable in your `$PATH`

# Installation

    pip3 install --user scenecut_extractor

Or clone this repository, then run the tool with `python3 -m scenecut_extractor`.

# Usage

Run:

    scenecut_extractor <input-file>

This might take a while depending on the length of your input file, and then output a list of scene cuts in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "frame": 114,
    "pts": 114.0,
    "pts_time": 3.8,
    "score": 0.445904
  },
  {
    "frame": 159,
    "pts": 159.0,
    "pts_time": 5.3,
    "score": 0.440126
  }
]
```

# Extended Usage

The command supports the following arguments and options:

- `-t`, `--threshold`: set threshold between 0 and 1 (default: 0.3)
- `-o`, `--output`: one of `{all,frames,seconds}`, output either all info, or only frame number, or timestamp in seconds
- `-of`, `--output-format`: one of `{json,csv}` (default: json)
- `-v`, `--verbose`: show the ffmpeg command
- `-p`, `--progress`: show a progress bar (useful for longer videos)
- `-h`, `--help`: show help message and exit

You can use the `-t` parameter to set the threshold that ffmpeg internally uses (between 0 and 1) – if you set it to 0, all frames will be printed with their probabilities.
