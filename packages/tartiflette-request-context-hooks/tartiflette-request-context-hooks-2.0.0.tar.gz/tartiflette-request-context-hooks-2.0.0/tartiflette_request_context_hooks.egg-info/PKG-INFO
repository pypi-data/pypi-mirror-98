Description: # Tartiflette Request Context Hooks
        
        DEPRECATED, MOVED TO [tartiflette-middleware](https://github.com/daveoconnor/tartiflette-middleware/).
        
        Framework to facilitate the creation of per-request context data for your
        resolvers using simple python context managers. 
        
        Allows for processing of request/response headers, dependent on the
        http server you're using.
        
        Deprecated only because that name suits better.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install tartiflette-request-context-hooks
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        This requires:
        1. Creation of your hooks.
        1. Configuration of your hooks in your application.
        1. Update your resolvers to access your data.
        
        ### 1 - Creation of your hooks
        Create a context manager to run on each request.
        
        Example:
        
        ```python
        from tartiflette_request_contexts_hooks import BaseRequestContextHooks
        
        class MyContextHooks(BaseRequestContextHooks):
            # required short arbitrary unique hook label
            label = 'MyHk'
            
            def __init__(self, my_hook_params):
                BaseRequestContextHooks.__init__(self)
                # do things necessary for repeated use across all of the requests, e.g.
                # configure factories
        
            async def __aenter__(self):
                # provide the data or method to be used in all queries for a single
                # request. 
                your_method_or_data = ...
                # store the data/method to be reused for this request
                await self.store_request_data(your_method_or_data)
        
            async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
                # optional: for if you need to do something when the request is
                # completed
                data = await self.get_request_data()
                data.close_or_whatever()
        ```
        
        There are more examples in the examples directory including one with access to
        AIOHTTP request headers.
        
        ### 2 - Configuration of your hooks in your app
        
        Currently only AIOHTTP is supported but the library is extensible if others
        would like to submit a pull request to support other servers that Tartiflette
        supports.
        
        Limited AIOHTTP setup example, imports and configuration kept to hook specific
        details:
        
        ```python
        from tartiflette_request_context_hooks.middleware import aiohttp
        from tartiflette_request_context_hooks import RequestContextHooks
        import MyContextHooks # your hook
        
        my_hook = RequestContextHooks(
             context_manager=MyContextHooks(
                  my_hooks_params={},
             ),
             server_middleware=aiohttp    
        )
        
        app = web.Application(middlewares=[
            my_hook.middleware
        ])
        ctx = {
            'my_session_service': my_hook.service,
        }
        web.run_app(
            register_graphql_handlers(
                # your configuration
                executor_context=ctx,
            )
        )
        ```
        
        ### 3 - Access data in your resolvers' context
        
        Works in queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
        
        ```python
        @Resolver('Query.whatever')
        async def resolve_query_user_login(parent, args, ctx, info):
            my_data = await ctx['my_session_service']()
        ```
