======================
SensiML Python Client
======================

SensiML python client provides programmatic interface to SensiML REST API's for
building machine learning pipelines including data processing, feature
generation and classification for developing smart sensor algorithms optimized
to run on embedded devices.

------------
Installation
------------

Download the Analytic Studio which will install a python 3 environment  along with all the requirements 
to run the SensiML Library.

    https://sensiml.com/download/


You can also install directly from pypy repository using pip. We recommend  having python >= 3.7

    pip install sensiml

Our library is designed to be used within a jupyter notebook. For our
GUI to work correctly you will need to also install nbextension to
jupyter notebook. Installation instructions can be found here

https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

You will need to enable the following extensions. bqplot, ipywidgets and qgrid.

    jupyter contrib nbextension install --sys-prefix

    jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix bqplot

    jupyter nbextension enable--sys-prefix ipywidgets

    jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix qgrid

----------------------------------
Connect to SensiML Analytic Engine
----------------------------------

Once you have installed the software, you can connect to the server by running the following
in a notebook cell.

    from sensiml import *

    dsk = SensiML()

Connecting to SensiML servers requires and account, you can register at https://sensiml.com

Documentation can be found here https://sensiml.com/documentation/ as well as in the Analytic Studio.
