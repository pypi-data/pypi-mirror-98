    [:bug:`1690433`] "Get me a network" feature provided by nova and neutron
    is now exposed in the launch server form.
    This feature will sets up a neutron network topology for a project
    if there is no network in the project. It simplifies the workflow when
    launching a server.
    In the horizon support, when there is no network which can be used
    for a server, a dummy network named 'auto_allocated_network' is shown
    in the network choices.
    The feature is disabled by default because it requires preparations
    in your neutron deployment.
    To enable it, set ``enable_auto_allocated_network`` in
    ``OPENSTACK_NEUTRON_NETWORK`` to ``True``.
