    [`blueprint ng-users <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/ng-users>`_]
    AngularJS-based Users panel is added. The features in the legacy
    panel are almost implemented. The Users panel now may be configured
    to use either the legacy or AngularJS-based codes.
    The ANGULAR_FEATURES setting now allows for a `users_panel`.
    If set to True, then the AngularJS-Based Users panel will be used,
    while the Django version will be used if set to False.
    Default value for users_panel is False, due to lack of extensional
    buttons, i.e. for showing password and adding project, see also
    [`bug/1733271 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/1744271>`_].

    has Angularized, but buttons showing passwords is not implemented, i.e.
    for Password, Confirm Password and Admin password. Also, button adding
    project for selection of Primary Project is not implemented.
