    (for horizon plugin developers) Django workflow step is now pluggable and
    horizon plugins can add extra step(s) to an existing workflow provided by
    horizon or other horizon plugins. Extra steps can be added via the horizon
    plugin "enabled" file. For more detail, see ``EXTRA_TABS`` description in
    `Pluggable Panels and Groups <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/configuration/pluggable_panels.html#extra-steps>`__
    of the horizon documentation.
upgrade:
  - The "Quotas" tab in the "Create Project" form was split out into
    a new separate form "Modify Quotas". Quotas for a new project need to
    be configured from "Modify Quotas" action after creating a new project.
