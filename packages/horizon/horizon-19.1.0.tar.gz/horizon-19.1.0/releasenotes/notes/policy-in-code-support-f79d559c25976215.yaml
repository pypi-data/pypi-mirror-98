features:
  - |
    Horizon supports the registered default policies and operators now
    only need to define policies which they would like to override in policy
    files in ``POLICY_FILES`` setting. (Previously the policy files need to
    contain all defined policies including default policies.)
    The registered default policies are defined in files under
    ``DEFAULT_POLICY_FILES`` and they are synced with registered defaults
    of back-end services before the horizon release.
issues:
  - |
    Policies with the system scoped token (``system_scope:all``) are not
    supported in horizon yet. The horizon team recognizes it as an important
    feature gap and would like to support it in near future.
upgrade:
  - |
    The format of the policy files under ``POLICY_FILES`` is changed to YAML
    and all contents of these files are commented out now. You only need to
    define policies which you would like to modify from the default.
    You can still use policy files with JSON format. If you continue to use
    JSON format, configure ``POLICY_FILES`` setting to point JSON files.
