    [:bug:`1763204`]
    Use of this 'djano.wsgi' file has been deprecated since the Rocky
    release in favor of 'wsgi.py' in the 'openstack_dashboard' module. This
    file is a legacy naming from before Django 1.4 and an importable
    'wsgi.py' is now the default. This file will be removed in the T release
    cycle.
