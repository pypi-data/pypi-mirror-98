  - |
    The following deprecated settings have been dropped.

    * ``HORIZON_IMAGES_ALLOW_UPLOAD`` (deprecated in Newton):
      Use ``HORIZON_IMAGES_UPLOAD_MODE`` instead.
    * ``CUSTOM_THEME_PATH`` and ``DEFAULT_THEME_PATH``
      (both deprecated in Mitaka): Use AVAILABLE_THEMES instead.
    * ``OPENSTACK_TOKEN_HASH_ENABLED`` (deprecated in Mitaka):
      PKI tokens currently work with hashing (before Ocata) and
      Keystone already dropped PKI token support in Ocata.
    * ``TOKEN_DELETION_DISABLED`` (deprecated in Ocata):
      It was not marked as deprecated in the horizon documentation,
      but this had no effect since Ocata release.
