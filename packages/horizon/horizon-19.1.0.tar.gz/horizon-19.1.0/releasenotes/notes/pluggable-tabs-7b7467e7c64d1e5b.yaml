    [:bug:`1746754`]
    (for horizon plugin developers) Django tab is now pluggable and horizon
    plugins can add extra tab(s) to an existing tab provided by horizon or
    other horizon plugins. Extra tabs can be added via the horizon plugin
    "enabled" file. For more detail, see ``EXTRA_TABS`` description in
    `Pluggable Panels and Groups <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/configuration/pluggable_panels.html#extra-tabs>`__
    of the horizon documentation.
