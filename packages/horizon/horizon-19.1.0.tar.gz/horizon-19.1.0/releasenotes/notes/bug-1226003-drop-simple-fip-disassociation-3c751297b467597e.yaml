    Floating IP can be released when it is disassociated from a server.
    "Release Floating IP" checkbox is now available in "Disassociate
    Floating IP" form.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``simple_ip_management`` setting in ``HORIZON_CONFIG`` was dropped.
    This actually has no meaning after nova-network support was dropped in Pike.
    If you use this setting to hide ``Disassociate Floating IP`` button in the
    instance table, use the policy file instead.
