features:
  - Added a new ``hide_create_volume`` setting under the
    ``LAUNCH_INSTANCE_DEFAULTS`` dict. This allows you to hide the
    "Create New Volume" option in the "Launch Instance" form and instead rely
    on the default value you select with ``create_volume`` is the best suitable
    option for your users.
