    [:bug:`1544703`] Add a new optional WEBSSO_KEYSTONE_URL property to
    facilitate WEBSSO deployments where network segmentation is used per
    security requirement. In this case, the controllers are not reachable
    from public network. Therefore, user's browser will not be able to access
    OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL if it is set to the internal endpoint.
