    [:blueprint:`cinder-generic-volume-groups`]
    Cinder generic groups is now supported. Consistency groups views will be
    disabled if the generic group support is available. User is able to
    create generic groups and snapshots now.

    Note that operators need to create at least one group type so that
    users can use the generic group feature. Otherwise, it might be better
    to disable the group and group snapshot panels by the horizon plugin
    ``enabled`` files.
