# sphinx-aimms-theme

This [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) theme was designed to provide a great reader experience for documentation users on both desktop and mobile devices for AIMMS projects and libraries.

**This theme also includes:** 
- an **[AIMMS pygment lexer](docs/AIMMS Lexer.md)** to highlight your AIMMS [code blocks in sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block) 
- an **[AIMMS Domain](docs/AIMMS Domain.md)** to document your own AIMMS code, and to [**crosslink** with other AIMMS documentation websites ](https://gitlab.com/ArthurdHerbemont/sphinx-aimms-theme/blob/master/docs/AIMMS%20Domain.md#coupling-the-domain-with-intersphinx)

Please find the documentation of those 2 elements following the links above.

This theme is inherited from the great [Read the Docs](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) but can work with any Sphinx project. 

You can find a working demo of the theme on AIMMS documentation websites:
- [AIMMS Function reference](https://documentation.aimms.com/functionreference)
- [AIMMS How-to](https://how-to.aimms.com)
- [AIMMS Documentation](https://documentation.aimms.com)

**To generate your docs out of this theme** from an AIMMS model, please take a look at the following repo: https://gitlab.com/ArthurdHerbemont/conversion-aimms-ams2rst

Installation
===============

This theme is distributed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-aimms-theme/) and can be installed with pip. 

Because it's inheriting some features from [Read the Docs theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme), you will need to install it as well. 
You may run the following 2 commands to install it:

`pip install sphinx-rtd-theme`

`pip install sphinx-aimms-theme`

To use the theme in your Sphinx project, you will need to add the following to your conf.py file:

    ...
    "sphinx_aimms_theme",
]

html_theme = "sphinx_aimms_theme"
```

        <script>
            window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
        
            function gtag() {

Theme source code
-------------------

The theme source code can be found in your Python installation folder, at ``PythonXX\Lib\site-packages\sphinx_aimms_theme``.

You may customize (overwrite) locally parts of it via "templating", as described [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/templating.html)

Home Page
----------

Some CSS code is shipped together with the theme to customize your home page "boxes", as you can see on [AIMMS How-to](https://how-to.aimms.com) or [AIMMS Documentation](https://documentation.aimms.com).

You may (or not) use it to show your own topics. To help you customize it, please see the [RST](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html) source code of the How-to Home page below:
