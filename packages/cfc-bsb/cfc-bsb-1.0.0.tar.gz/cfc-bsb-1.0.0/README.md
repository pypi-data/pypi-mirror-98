## How JPRQ is different from Ngrok?

- JPRQ is a free and open-source Ngrok alternative to expose local servers online easily.
- It allows developers to serve unlimited requests to the local server compared to Ngrok's **40 requests/minute** limit.
- It can expose multiple ports at the same time compared to Ngrok with **1 port** limit.

## [NEW] Custom Subdomain

## Limitations

- Cannot expose WebSocket
- Doesn't work with HTTP Polling

## Troubleshooting

- With serving React, Vue or any other modern web apps, make sure you run production server or build the app and serve static files as JPRQ is not capable of exposing Websocket.
