Description: # roboplot
        
        Library of plotting functions for everything robotics
        
        ## About
        
        `roboplot` aims to provide a set of easy to use functions for plotting various data and visualizations related to robotics.
        The goal is for this to be fully featured and easy to use, in a functional style, to aid in rapid prototyping.
        
        As such, `roboplot` leverages `gtsam` heavily for access to robotics primitives that are easy to work with. `gtsam` supports conversions to and from other libraries, in case you prefer something else.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Simply run
        
        ```sh
        pip install roboplot
        ```
        
        To install a development version, run `pip install -e .` in the root directory.

        ### Feature Requests
        
        - Support for measurement streams
        - Add [meshcat](https://github.com/rdeits/meshcat-python) support so we can view plots on browsers.
        - Support for [Polyscope](https://github.com/nmwsharp/polyscope) for 3D geometry plotting.
        - [bqplot](https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot)
        - [IPyVolume](https://ipyvolume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for 3D shapes?
