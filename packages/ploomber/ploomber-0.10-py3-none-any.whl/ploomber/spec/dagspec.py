Path management
---------------
Relative paths are heavily used for pointing to source files and products,
when only the Python API existed, this was unambiguous: all paths
were relative to the current working directory, you only had to make sure
to start the session at the right place. Initially, the Spec API didn't
change a thing since the assumption was that one would convert a spec to
a DAG in a folder containing a pipeline.yaml, under this scenario the
current directory is also the parent of pipeline.yaml so all relative paths
work as expected.

However, when we introduced the Jupyter custom contents manager things
changed because the DAG can be initialized from directories where there
isn't a pipeline.yaml but we have to recursively look for one. Furthermore,
if extract_upstream or extract_product are True and the source files do
not share the parent with pipeline.yaml an ambiguity arises: are paths
inside a source file relative to the source file, current directory or
pipeline.yaml?

When we started working on Soopervisor, the concept of "project" arised,
which is a folder that contains all necessary files to instantiate a
Ploomber pipeline. To take current directory ambiguity out of the situation
we decided that projects that use the Spec API should ignore the current
directory and assume that *all relative paths in the spec are so to the
pipeline.yaml parent folder* this means that we could initialize projects
from anywhere by just pointing to the project's root folder (the one that
contains pipeline.yaml). This is implemented in TaskSpec.py@init_product
where we add the project's root folder to all relative paths. This implies
that all relative paths are converted to absolute to make them agnostic
from the current working directory. The basic idea is that a person
writing a DAG spec should only have to know that paths are relative
to the project's root folder and the DAGSpec should do the heavy lifting
of instantiating a spec that could be converted to a dag (and reendered)
independent of the working directory, because the project's root folder
defines the pipelines's scope, and there is no point in looking for files
outside of it, except when asking explicity through an absolute path.

However, this behavior clashes with the Jupyter notebook defaults. Jupyter
sets the current working directory not to the directory where
"jupyter {notebook/lab}" was called but to the current file parent's.
Our current logic would override this default behavior so we added an
option to turn it back on (product_relative_to_source).

Note that this does not affect the Python API, since that would create more
confusion. The Python API should work as expected from any other library:
paths should be relative to the current working directory.

The only case where we can't determine a project's root is when a DAGSpec
is initialized from a dictionary directly, but this is not something
that end-users would do.

Spec sections
-------------
"meta" is for settings that cannot be clearly mapped to the OOP Python
interface, we don't call it config because there is a DAGConfig object in
the Python API and this might cause confusion

All other sections should represent valid DAG properties.


Partials [Provisional name]
---------------------------
Partials were introduced to support a common ML use case: train and serving
pipelines. If we describe a training pipeline as a DAG, the only difference
with its serving counterpart are the tasks (can be more than one) at the
beginning (train: get historical data, serve: get single data point) and the
end (train: fit a model, serve: load a model and predict). Everything that
happens in the middle should be the same to avoid training-serving skew. There
are two specific use cases: batch and online.

To define a batch serving pipeline we define three files: pipeline.yaml
(train DAG), pipeline-serve (serve DAG), and pipeline-features.yaml (partial).
The first two follow the DAGSpec schema and use
``import_tasks_from: pipeline-features.yaml``. Training is done via
``ploomber build --entry-point pipeline.yaml`` and serving via
``ploomber build --entry-point pipeline-serve.yaml``.

An online API has a different mechanism because the inference pipeline needs
a Python API to interface with a web framework, rpc, or similar. This logic
is implemented by OnlineDAG, which takes a partial definition
(e.g. ``pipeline-features.yaml``) and builds an in-memory DAG that can make
predictions using ``OnlineDAG().predict()``. See ``OnlineDAG`` documentation
for details.

class DAGSpec(MutableMapping):
    """
    A DAG spec is a dictionary with certain structure that can be converted
    to a DAG using DAGSpec.to_dag().

    There are two cases: the simplest one is just a dictionary with a
    "location" key with the factory to call, the other explicitly describes
    the DAG structure as a dictionary.

    When .to_dag() is called, the current working directory is temporarily
    switched to the spec file parent folder (only applies when loading from
    a file)

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : str, pathlib.Path or dict
        Path to a YAML spec or dict spec to construct the DAG

    env : dict, pathlib.path or str, optional
        Dictionary or path/str to a YAML file with the environment to use,
        tags in any of the keys (i.e. {{some_tag}}) in "data" will be replaced
        by the corresponding values in "env". A regular :py:mod:`ploomber.Env`
        object is created, see documentation for details. If None and
        data is a dict, no env is loaded. If None and loaded from a YAML spec,
        an env.yaml file is loaded (in the current working diirectory), if
        it doesn't exist, it is loaded from the YAML spec parent folder, if it
        exists. If none of these exist, no env is loaded.

    lazy_import : bool, optional
        Whether to import dotted paths to initialize PythonCallables with the
        actual function. If False, PythonCallables are initialized directly
        with the dotted path, which means some verifications such as import
        statements in that function's module are delayed until the pipeline
        is executed. This also applies to placeholders loaded using a
        SourceLoader, if a placeholder exists, it will return the path
        to it, instead of an initialized Placeholder object, if it doesn't,
        it will return None instead of raising an error.

    reload : bool, optional
        Reloads modules before getting dotted paths. Has no effect if
        lazy_import=True
