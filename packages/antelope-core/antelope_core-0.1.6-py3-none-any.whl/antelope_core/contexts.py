"""
Contexts in this sense are environmental compartments, except they have the added capability to keep lists of origins.

Edelen and Ingwersen et al 2017:
"Recommendations: ...setting an exclusive or inclusive nomenclature for flow context information that includes
directionality and environmental compartment information."

In the antelope architecture, there are two different objectives for handling contexts as-presented by the data source.

 In the default case, for every static resource or stand-alone archive a "TermManager" is created which is captive to
 the archive.  The role of this class is to collect information from the data source in as close to its native
 presentation as possible. This creates an "inclusive" nomenclature for the source.

 In the Catalog case, catalog's local quantity DB is an LciaEngine, which is also shared among all foreground
 resources.  In this case the objective is to match a given context to the existing (exclusive) nomenclature built-in
 to the LciaEngine, so that contexts are guaranteed to coincide during LCIA.

In order to accomplish this, the native add_context() method needs to be expansive, fault tolerant, and widely accepting
of diverse inputs, whereas find_matching_context() needs to be more discerning and rigorous.  Thus the former accepts
a tuple of string terms or a context, but the latter requires a context.  find_matching_context searches first bottom-up
then top-down to look for matches.  It requires an input context to have an origin already specified, so that the
resources can assign "hints" that map local terms to canonical contexts on an origin-specific basis.

Note that a "matching" generally requires an exact (case-insensitive) match to an entry in the contexts database.
Curation of the synonym set is required.

Because contexts must be directional, some terms are protected as ambiguous: "air", "water", and "ground" should be
avoided in favor of explicit "from air" or "to air" or synonyms.

The NullContext is a singleton defined in this file that is meant to imply no specific context.  It is interpreted in
two different ways:
 - on the characterization side, NullContext indicates the characterization has no specific context, and thus applies to
   all contexts, as long as a more applicable characterization is not found.
 - on the query side, NullContext indicates that a context was specified but no match was found.  Queries with
   NullContext should not match any existing characterizations (except NullContext itself).

The NullContext should be returned by the context manager
