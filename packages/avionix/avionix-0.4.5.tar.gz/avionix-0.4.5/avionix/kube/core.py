    :param host_network: Host networking requested for this pod. Use the host's network \
        namespace. If this option is set, the ports that will be used must be \
        specified. Default to false.
    :param host_pid: Use the host's pid namespace. Optional: Default to false.
    :param hostname: Specifies the hostname of the Pod If not specified, the pod's \
        hostname will be set to a system-defined value.
    :param image_pull_secrets: ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to \
        secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by \
        this PodSpec. If specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller \
        implementations for them to use. For example, in the case of docker, only \
        DockerConfig type secrets are honored. More info: \
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod  # noqa
    :param init_containers: List of initialization containers belonging to the pod. \
        Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If \
        any init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled \
        according to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal \
        container must be unique among all containers. Init containers may not have \
        Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes. The \
        resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during \
        scheduling by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and \
        then using the max of of that value or the sum of the normal containers. \
        Limits are applied to init containers in a similar fashion. Init containers \
        cannot currently be added or removed. Cannot be updated. More info: \
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/
    :param node_name: NodeName is a request to schedule this pod onto a specific node. \
        If it is non-empty, the scheduler simply schedules this pod onto that node, \
        assuming that it fits resource requirements.
    :param node_selector: NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to \
        fit on a node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be \
        scheduled on that node. More info: \
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/
    :param overhead: Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running \
        a pod for a given RuntimeClass. This field will be autopopulated at admission \
        time by the RuntimeClass admission controller. If the RuntimeClass admission \
        controller is enabled, overhead must not be set in Pod create requests. The \
        RuntimeClass admission controller will reject Pod create requests which have \
        the overhead already set. If RuntimeClass is configured and selected in the \
        PodSpec, Overhead will be set to the value defined in the corresponding \
        RuntimeClass, otherwise it will remain unset and treated as zero. More info: \
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/20190226-pod-overhead.md This \
        field is alpha-level as of Kubernetes v1.16, and is only honored by servers \
        that enable the PodOverhead feature.
    :param preemption_policy: PreemptionPolicy is the Policy for preempting pods with \
        lower priority. One of Never, PreemptLowerPriority. Defaults to \
        PreemptLowerPriority if unset. This field is alpha-level and is only honored \
        by servers that enable the NonPreemptingPriority feature.
    :param priority: The priority value. Various system components use this field to \
        find the priority of the pod. When Priority Admission Controller is enabled, \
        it prevents users from setting this field. The admission controller populates \
        this field from PriorityClassName. The higher the value, the higher the \
        priority.
    :param priority_class_name: If specified, indicates the pod's priority. \
        "system-node-critical" and "system-cluster-critical" are two special keywords \
        which indicate the highest priorities with the former being the highest \
        priority. Any other name must be defined by creating a PriorityClass object \
        with that name. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if \
        there is no default.
    :param readiness_gates: If specified, all readiness gates will be evaluated for pod \
        readiness. A pod is ready when all its containers are ready AND all conditions \
        specified in the readiness gates have status equal to "True" More info: \
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-network/0007-pod-ready%2B%2B.md
    :param restart_policy: Restart policy for all containers within the pod. One of \
        Always, OnFailure, Never. Default to Always. More info: \
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#restart-policy  # noqa
    :param runtime_class_name: RuntimeClassName refers to a RuntimeClass object in the \
        node.k8s.io group, which should be used to run this pod.  If no RuntimeClass \
        resource matches the named class, the pod will not be run. If unset or empty, \
        the "legacy" RuntimeClass will be used, which is an implicit class with an \
        empty definition that uses the default runtime handler. More info: \
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md This is a beta \
        feature as of Kubernetes v1.14.
    :param scheduler_name: If specified, the pod will be dispatched by specified \
        scheduler. If not specified, the pod will be dispatched by default scheduler.
    :param security_context: SecurityContext holds pod-level security attributes and \
        common container settings. Optional: Defaults to empty.  See type description \
        for default values of each field.
    :param service_account: DeprecatedServiceAccount is a depreciated alias for \
        ServiceAccountName. Deprecated: Use serviceAccountName instead.
    :param service_account_name: ServiceAccountName is the name of the ServiceAccount \
        to use to run this pod. More info: \
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/  # noqa
    :param share_process_namespace: Share a single process namespace between all of the \
        containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and \
        signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process \
        in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and \
        ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set. Optional: Default to false.
    :param subdomain: If specified, the fully qualified Pod hostname will be \
        "<hostname>.<subdomain>.<pod namespace>.svc.<cluster domain>". If not \
        specified, the pod will not have a domainname at all.
    :param termination_grace_period_seconds: Optional duration in seconds the pod needs \
        to terminate gracefully. May be decreased in delete request. Value must be \
        non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete immediately. If this \
        value is nil, the default grace period will be used instead. The grace period \
        is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent a \
        termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a \
        kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your \
        process. Defaults to 30 seconds.
    :param tolerations: If specified, the pod's tolerations.
    :param topology_spread_constraints: TopologySpreadConstraints describes how a group \
        of pods ought to spread across topology domains. Scheduler will schedule pods \
        in a way which abides by the constraints. This field is only honored by \
        clusters that enable the EvenPodsSpread feature. All topologySpreadConstraints \
        are ANDed.
    :param volumes: List of volumes that can be mounted by containers belonging to the \
        pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes

    :param external_ips: externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the \
        cluster will also accept traffic for this service.  These IPs are not managed \
        by Kubernetes.  The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a \
        node with this IP.  A common example is external load-balancers that are not \
        part of the Kubernetes system.
    :param external_name: externalName is the external reference that kubedns or \
        equivalent will return as a CNAME record for this service. No proxying will be \
        involved. Must be a valid RFC-1123 hostname \
        (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123) and requires Type to be ExternalName.
    :param external_traffic_policy: externalTrafficPolicy denotes if this Service \
        desires to route external traffic to node-local or cluster-wide endpoints. \
        "Local" preserves the client source IP and avoids a second hop for \
        LoadBalancer and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially imbalanced \
        traffic spreading. "Cluster" obscures the client source IP and may cause a \
        second hop to another node, but should have good overall load-spreading.
    :param health_check_node_port: healthCheckNodePort specifies the healthcheck \
        nodePort for the service. If not specified, HealthCheckNodePort is created by \
        the service api backend with the allocated nodePort. Will use user-specified \
        nodePort value if specified by the client. Only effects when Type is set to \
        LoadBalancer and ExternalTrafficPolicy is set to Local.
    :param ip_family: ipFamily specifies whether this Service has a preference for a \
        particular IP family (e.g. IPv4 vs. IPv6).  If a specific IP family is \
        requested, the clusterIP field will be allocated from that family, if it is \
        available in the cluster.  If no IP family is requested, the cluster's primary \
        IP family will be used. Other IP fields (loadBalancerIP, \
        loadBalancerSourceRanges, externalIPs) and controllers which allocate external \
        load-balancers should use the same IP family.  Endpoints for this Service will \
        be of this family.  This field is immutable after creation. Assigning a \
        ServiceIPFamily not available in the cluster (e.g. IPv6 in IPv4 only cluster) \
        is an error condition and will fail during clusterIP assignment.
    :param load_balancer_ip: Only applies to Service Type: LoadBalancer LoadBalancer \
        will get created with the IP specified in this field. This feature depends on \
        whether the underlying cloud-provider supports specifying the loadBalancerIP \
        when a load balancer is created. This field will be ignored if the \
        cloud-provider does not support the feature.
    :param load_balancer_source_ranges: If specified and supported by the platform, \
        this will restrict traffic through the cloud-provider load-balancer will be \
        restricted to the specified client IPs. This field will be ignored if the \
        cloud-provider does not support the feature." More info: \
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-cloud-provider-firewall/  # noqa
    :param publish_not_ready_addresses: publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, \
        indicates that DNS implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of \
        subsets for the Endpoints associated with the Service. The default value is \
        false. The primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's \
        Headless Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to \
        their readiness for purpose of peer discovery.
    :param selector: Route service traffic to pods with label keys and values matching \
        this selector. If empty or not present, the service is assumed to have an \
        external process managing its endpoints, which Kubernetes will not modify. \
        Only applies to types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. Ignored if type \
        is ExternalName. More info: \
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/
    :param session_affinity: Supports "ClientIP" and "None". Used to maintain session \
        affinity. Enable client IP based session affinity. Must be ClientIP or None. \
        Defaults to None. More info: \
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies  # noqa
    :param session_affinity_config: sessionAffinityConfig contains the configurations \
        of session affinity.
    :param topology_keys: topologyKeys is a preference-order list of topology keys \
        which implementations of services should use to preferentially sort endpoints \
        when accessing this Service, it can not be used at the same time as \
        externalTrafficPolicy=Local. Topology keys must be valid label keys and at \
        most 16 keys may be specified. Endpoints are chosen based on the first \
        topology key with available backends. If this field is specified and all \
        entries have no backends that match the topology of the client, the service \
        has no backends for that client and connections should fail. The special value \
        "*" may be used to mean "any topology". This catch-all value, if used, only \
        makes sense as the last value in the list. If this is not specified or empty, \
        no topology constraints will be applied.
    :param typeValid options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer. \
        "ExternalName" maps to the specified externalName. "ClusterIP" allocates a \
        cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints. Endpoints are \
        determined by the selector or if that is not specified, by manual construction \
        of an Endpoints object. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is allocated and \
        the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather than a stable IP. \
        "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which routes \
        to the clusterIP. "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external \
        load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the \
        clusterIP. More info: \
