    :param path: Path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it \
        can contain characters disallowed from the conventional "path" part of a URL \
        as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/'. When unspecified, all \
        paths from incoming requests are matched.
    :param path_type: PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. \
        PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path \
        exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching \
        is   done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the   \
        list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a   match \
        for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the   request path. \
        Note that if the last element of the path is a substring   of the last element \
        in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar   matches /foo/bar/baz, but \
        does not match /foo/barbaz). * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the \
        Path matching is up to   the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a \
        separate PathType   or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types. \
        Implementations are required to support all path types. Defaults to \
        ImplementationSpecific.

    :param http: None
    :param host: Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined \
        by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the "host" part of the URI as \
        defined in RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can \
        only apply to    the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress. 2. The `:` \
        delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed.       Currently the \
        port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and       :443 for https. Both \
        these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host \
        before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes \
        all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue.  Host can be "precise" \
        which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. \
        "foo.bar.com") or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single \
        wildcard label (e.g. "*.foo.com"). The wildcard character '\\*' must appear by \
        itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have \
        a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == "*"). Requests will be matched \
        against the Host field in the following way: 1. If Host is precise, the \
        request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host \
        is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header is \
        to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.

class IngressSpec(HelmYaml):
    """
    :param ingress_class_name: IngressClassName is the name of the IngressClass cluster \
        resource. The associated IngressClass defines which controller will implement \
        the resource. This replaces the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` \
        annotation. For backwards compatibility, when that annotation is set, it must \
        be given precedence over this field. The controller may emit a warning if the \
        field and annotation have different values. Implementations of this API should \
        ignore Ingresses without a class specified. An IngressClass resource may be \
        marked as default, which can be used to set a default value for this field. \
        For more information, refer to the IngressClass documentation.
    :param backend: A default backend capable of servicing requests that don't match \
        any rule. At least one of 'backend' or 'rules' must be specified. This field \
        is optional to allow the loadbalancer controller or defaulting logic to \
        specify a global default.
    :param rules: A list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, \
        or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend.
    :param tls: TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS \
        port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will \
        be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through \
        the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress \
        supports SNI.
