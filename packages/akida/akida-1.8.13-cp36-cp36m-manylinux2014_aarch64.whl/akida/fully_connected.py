    """This is used for most processing purposes, since any neuron in the layer
    can be connected to any input channel.

    Outputs are returned from FullyConnected layers as a list of events, that
    is, as a triplet of x, y and feature values. However, FullyConnected
    models by definition have no intrinsic spatial organization. Thus, all
    output events have x and y values of zero with only the f value being
    meaningful â€“ corresponding to the index of the event-generating neuron.
    Note that each neuron can only generate a single event for each packet of
    inputs processed.

    Args:
        num_neurons (int): number of neurons (filters).
        name (str, optional): name of the layer.
        weights_bits (int, optional): number of bits used to quantize weights.
        activations_enabled (bool, optional): enable or disable activation
            function.
        threshold_fire (int, optional): threshold for neurons to fire or
            generate an event.
        threshold_fire_step (float, optional): length of the potential
            quantization intervals.
        threshold_fire_bits (int, optional): number of bits used to
            quantize the neuron response.
