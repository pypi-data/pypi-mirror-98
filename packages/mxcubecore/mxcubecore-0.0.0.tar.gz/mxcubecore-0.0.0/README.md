# Backend of MXCuBE
mxcubecore is the back-end level of [MXCuBE Qt](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcube/) and [MXCuBE Web](https://github.com/mxcube/mxcube3/)  allowing to access the beamline control system and instrumentation. It acts as a container of single python objects (called hardware objects).
