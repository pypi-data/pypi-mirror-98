Changelog for Mantarray Waveform Analysis
=========================================

0.7.0 (2021-03-17)
------------------

- Updated calculations to convert magnetic data to Force


0.6.0 (2021-03-01)
------------------

- Added twitch contraction and relaxation velocity metrics to metric dicitonaries


0.5.11 (2021-02-17)
------------------

- Fixed TwoValleysInARowError present in h5 file due to ``peak_detector`` function


0.5.10 (2020-11-17)
------------------

- Updated dependencies to be compatible with Python 3.9


0.5.8 (2020-11-10)
------------------

- Fixed issue with peak detection on data with no detected valleys.


0.5.6 (2020-11-04)
------------------

- Fixed ``publish`` job.

- Fixed incorrect raising of TwoValleysInARowError.
- Fixed issue with two valleys incorrectly being found between peaks.


0.5.4 (2020-09-30)
------------------
