Description: Simple Python framework for performing file polling.
        
        It polls for files in the specified input directory and moves them to the output directory. Methods for checking
        the files (e.g., whether an image is valid) and processing them can be supplied to the poller instance.
        Optionally, the input files can be deleted rather than moved.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.0.10 (2021-03-18)
        -------------------
        
        - added the `output_num_files` boolean property to the `Poller` class, which extends the logging output by
          outputting a `x/y` string as well (x=current file index, y=total number of files in a batch)
        
        
        0.0.9 (2021-01-05)
        ------------------
        
        - the `Poller.logging` property no longer returns the `check_file` method
        
        
        0.0.8 (2020-12-11)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed high CPU usage (ie constant polling) when using unlimited files to list (`max_files=0`)
        - `poll_wait` and `watchdog_check_interval` are now float instead of int to allow for sub-second poll waits
        - internal delays when poller is busy have been dropped from 1s to 0.1s
        
        
        0.0.7 (2020-12-10)
        ------------------
        
        - `keyboard_interrupt` method is now public
        
        
        0.0.6 (2020-12-10)
        ------------------
        
        - fixed race condition between watchdog reacting to new files and watchdog checking for files at specific intervals
        - logging now distinguishes between DEBUG/INFO/ERROR levels
        - keyboard interrupts via CTRL+C are now handled correctly
        - in watchdog mode, an initial scan of the input directory is now performed, in case files were already present
        
        
        0.0.5 (2020-12-10)
        ------------------
        
        - added `params` object to allow attaching of arbitrary parameters to be used by the `check_file`
          and `process_file` methods; this avoids accidentally overriding Poller attributes that were
          introduced in later versions.
        
        
        0.0.4 (2020-12-10)
        ------------------
        
        - added support for using watchdog for reacting to file creation events, speeding up polling
        
        
        0.0.3 (2020-12-04)
        ------------------
        
        - `poll` method now skips directories, which could be listed if no extensions are supplied to restrict the polling.
        
        
        0.0.2 (2020-12-03)
        ------------------
        
        - added `other_input_files` glob list and `delete_other_input_files` to manage additional files that may
          reside in the input directory along side the actual files that are being processed.
        
        
        0.0.1 (2020-12-02)
        ------------------
        
        - initial release
