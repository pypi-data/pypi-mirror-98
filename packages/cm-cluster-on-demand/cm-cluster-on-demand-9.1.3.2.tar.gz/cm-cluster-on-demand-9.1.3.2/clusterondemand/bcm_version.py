class BcmVersion(object):
    """A utility class for comparing Bright Cluster Manager versions.

    Wraps a version number string and handles comparison logic. The string cannot contain a revision
    suffix, yet.

    Hard-coded assumption: At Bright, once we start working on BCM with major version X, then we
    will never release another minor version of a major X-1. That is: there will never be a release
    of something like 8.4 if 9.0 has been released (even internally).

    Also, it doesn't consider the tag after the dash (i.e: 8.1-2). This can be implemented in future if
    we see it as necessary
