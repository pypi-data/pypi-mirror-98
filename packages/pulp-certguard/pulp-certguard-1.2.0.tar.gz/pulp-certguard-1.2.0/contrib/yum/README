This is a yum plugin for people who need to support rhel versions that do not have dnf as an option.

The installation is fairly straight forward. And is further explained in the yum-minihowto in the docs directory.

Edit the certguard.py file. Set the top level constants as you want them to be.

Using the Makefile or just manually copy the files where they need to be.
