Description: # EIDA Statistics aggregation
        
        This project should provide unified statistics about EIDA nodes usage.
            
        
        ## Aggregating data
        
        Each EIDA node prepares an aggregation of their logging file using the same script.
        
        This aggregation result is sent to a central database through a webservice provided by a central node
        
        ### Install and execute
        
        This program is intended for python3.6 and more.
        
        From [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/eida-statistics-aggregator/)
        
            pip install eida-statistics-aggregator
            eida_stats_aggregator --help
            
        
        Alternatively, if you want to install with `pipenv` , run 
        
            pipenv install
            pipenv shell
            pip install -e .
            eida_stats_aggregator --help
            
        
            
        For now, the log file from seiscomp is expected to be a list of JSON entries compressed with BZIP2.
        
        
        ### Exemples
        
        Aggregate one bz2 seiscomp logfile:
        
            eida_stats_aggregator --output-directory aggregates fdsnws-requests.log.2020-11-02.bz2
            
        Also available with stdin:
        
            echo "fdsnws-requests.log.2020-11-02.bz2" |  eida_stats_aggregator --output-directory
            
        You can also agregate several logfiles:
        
             eida_stats_aggregator --output-directory aggregates fdsnws-requests.log.2020-11-02.bz2  fdsnws-requests.log.2020-11-03.bz2
             
        ### Registering the aggregation to the central statistics service
        
        In order to register, you first need a token. Please ask for one by submitting an issue in https://github.com/eida/etc/issues/
        
        When you have a valid token, you can send all your aggregation files with curl :
        
            gunzip -c aggregationfile.json.gz | curl  --header "Authentication: Bearer MYSECRETTOKEN"  --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d "@-"  https://ws.resif.fr/eidaws/statistics/1/dataselectstats
            
        The aggregation script can do this for you on the fly :
        
            eida_stats_aggregator -o aggregates fdsn-requests.log.2020-11-02.bz2 --token MYSECRETTOKEN --send-to https://ws.resif.fr/eidaws/statistics/1/dataselectstats
            
        
        ### Test
        
        From the projet's root directory run 
        
            pipenv install
            pipenv shell
            python -m pytest tests/test_aggregator.py -s 
            
        ### Aggregation problems
        
        #### The Count distinct problem
        
        Some information requested by EIDA need to count distint occurences of information (an IP, a country). A naive approach counting distinct occurences on each day and each node can't be used to count the distinct occurences at a global scale nor for another timewindow.
        
        Enters HyperLogLog, an algorithm allowing to estimate occurences for different timeframe. hll is implemented in Python and PostgreSQL this is why this project uses both technologies.
        
        #### Anonimization
        
        We want to anonimize every data that can link to a person. This is why IP adresses are hashed using the same algorithm on each datacenter, in order to have consistant statistics.
        
        ## Ingesting data
        
        A webservice receiving POST request and ingesting the result in a database
        
        ## Creating reports
        
        This code create automatic reports from the database
