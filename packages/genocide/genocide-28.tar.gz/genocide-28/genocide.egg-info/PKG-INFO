        NAME
                GENOCIDE - the king of the netherlands commits genocide.
        
        SYNOPSIS
                gcd <cmd> [mods=mod1,mod2] 
        
        DESCCRIPTION
                GENOCIDE is a python3 package that holds evidence that the king of the
                netherlands is doing a genocide, a written response where the king
                of the netherlands confirmed taking note of “what i have written”, namely
                proof that medicine he uses in treatement laws like zyprexa, haldol,
                abilify and clozapine are poison. This means that the king of the
                netherlands is not using laws to provide care for the elderly,
                handicapped, psychiatric patients and criminals but is using the laws
                to administer poison. Poison that makes impotent, is both physical
                (contracted muscles) and mental (let people hallucinate) torture and
                kills members of the victim groups.
        
                GENOCIDE shows correspondence with the Internationnal Criminal Court
                about the genocide of the king of the netherlands (using the law to
                administer poison), including stats on suicide while the kings genocide
                is still going on. Status is that there is not a basis to proceed,
                whether the genocide doesn’t fit the description or the netherlands
                doesn’t want to cooperate with stopping the genocide the king of the
                netherlands is doing.
        
                GENOCIDE provides a IRC bot (genocided) that can run as a background daemon 
                for 24/7 a day presence in a IRC channel. You can use it to display RSS
                feeds, act as a UDP to IRC gateway, program your own commands for it
                and have it log objects on disk to search them.
