Description: ===================
        SQLAlchemy 2 Stubs
        ===================
        
        These are PEP-484 typing stubs for `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org>`
        1.4 and 2.0.  They are released concurrently along with
        a `Mypy extension <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html>`
        which is designed to work with these stubs, which assists primarily in the
        area of ORM mappings.
        
        The stubs replace the use of the "sqlalchemy-stubs" package published by
        Dropbox.  Differences include that these stubs are generated against
        1.4's API as well as some adjustments to the use of generics.
        
        This project should be considered **alpha level** and is not as mature
        as the Dropbox stubs for the initial release.
        
        See the Mypy plugin documentation at https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html
        for an overview of how to use PEP-484 annotations with ORM mapped classes.
