===================
SQLAlchemy 2 Stubs
===================

These are PEP-484 typing stubs for `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_
1.4 and 2.0.  They are released concurrently along with
a `Mypy extension <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html>`_
which is designed to work with these stubs, which assists primarily in the
area of ORM mappings.

The stubs replace the use of the "sqlalchemy-stubs" package published by
Dropbox.  Differences include that these stubs are generated against
1.4's API as well as some adjustments to the use of generics.

This project should be considered **alpha level** and is not as mature
as the Dropbox stubs for the initial release.

See the Mypy plugin documentation at https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/mypy.html
for an overview of how to use PEP-484 annotations with ORM mapped classes.
