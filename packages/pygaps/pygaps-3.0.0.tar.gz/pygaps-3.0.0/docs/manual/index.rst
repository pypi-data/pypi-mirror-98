Manual

An in-depth discussion of the concepts introduced in pyGAPS are presented in
this part of the documentation. These concepts should be understood in order to
work with the program, else one runs at risk of encountering errors or even
worse, encountering bad results without any errors.

A discussion regarding the core functionality and classes of pyGAPS is followed
by details on how to work with isotherms: import them, use characterisation
functions, fit various models and plot or export the results.
