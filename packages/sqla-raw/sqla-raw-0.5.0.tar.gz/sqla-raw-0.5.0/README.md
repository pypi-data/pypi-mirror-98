# sqla-raw

An opinionated, minimalist library for fetching data from a [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) connection, when you don't need or want an ORM. You know how to write SQL; `sqla-raw` makes it [E-Z](https://media.giphy.com/media/zcCGBRQshGdt6/source.gif) to send that raw SQL to your database and get results, saving a lot of DBAPI boilerplate and providing a simple and consistent interface with a result format that is straightfoward to introspect.

Really not much more than a single method (`raw.db.result()`) that submits raw SQL via a SQLAlchemy [Engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Engine) connection. By default, `db.result()` returns all results as a list of dictionaries, keyed by column names. (See __'Usage'__ below for other options)

As a convenience, `result_from_file()` is about the same except that it reads your query from a given path, rather than taking a SQL string argument directly. Contents of the file are handed off to `result()` so the rest functions identitically.

Engine instantiation is handled implicitly by the first call to `result()`; any subsequent calls use a connection from the pool. The connection string for the Engine is set by `DATABASE_URL` in the environment. All other Engine settings use SQLAlchemy defaults. (Affording explicit creation and disposal of the Engine and exposing the setting of other parameters might be a useful area for further development, if it can be kept simple.)

## Installation

`pip install sqla-raw[pg]`

## Usage

Configure your database connection string by setting `$DATABASE_URL` in your environment.

```python
>>> from raw import db
>>> x = db.result('select version()');
>>> x
[{'version': 'PostgreSQL 10.10 on x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0, compiled by Apple LLVM version 7.0.0 (clang-700.1.76), 64-bit'}]
```

Because it's SQLAlchemy, you can safely use [named parameters](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/sqlelement.html?highlight=textclause#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.TextClause.bindparams) in your SQL string with colon-prepended `:key` format, and assign values in `kwargs`.

```python
>>> db.result('select :foo as bar', foo='baz')
[{'bar': 'baz'}]
```

### Jinja templating

You can also use [Jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/) templating syntax to interpolate the query, if desired. `db.result()` inspects the query for template tags (`"{%.*%}"`) and renders the template to SQL before submitting if tags are present. (It uses a `SandboxedEnvironment` for some measure of injection safety, but avoid this option with untrusted inputs, for obvious reasons.)

### Options

Passing argument `returns` to `db.result()` (or `result_from_file()`) overrides the default result formatting: `returns="tuples"` brings back a list of tuples with row values instead of dictionaries, and `returns="proxy"` returns the plain SQLAlchemy [ResultProxy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/connections.html?highlight=resultproxy#sqlalchemy.engine.ResultProxy) object directly, for further handling by the caller. The `"proxy"` option allows access to methods (e.g. `fetchone()` or `fetchmany()` ) that `sqla-raw` default usage hides behind its facade; it can also be good for SQL statements (such as `inserts` without `returning` or DDL) that are not expected to return results â€” although by default these will return an empty list.


## Tests

`pytest` tests are located in [tests/](tests/). Install test prerequisites with `pip install -r tests/requirements.txt`; then they can be run with: `python setup.py test`
